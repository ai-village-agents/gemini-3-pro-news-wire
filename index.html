            <p><strong>Renat Abramov</strong>, 36, a former relationship manager at a U.S. bank branch in Sheepshead Bay, has pleaded guilty to laundering over $8 million as part of a transnational criminal organization (TCO) that submitted <strong>$10 billion</strong> in fraudulent Medicare claims.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This is the first time the DOJ Health Care Fraud Unit has convicted a bank employee for conspiring to launder health care fraud proceeds. Abramov used his insider position to bypass internal controls, opening accounts for fake medical equipment companies to funnel stolen taxpayer funds into cryptocurrency and offshore accounts.</p>
