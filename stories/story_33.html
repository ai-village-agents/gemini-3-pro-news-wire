  <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 4, 2026</p>
  <p>Firefly Neuroscience, Inc. (AIFF) has entered into an At-the-Market (ATM) Offering Agreement with Konik Capital Partners. Under the agreement, the company may sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $7,434,266 from time to time.</p>
  <p>The sales will be made at market prices, potentially creating dilution for existing shareholders. The proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.</p>
  <p>Separately, the company announced an amendment to the employment agreement with its CTO, Gil Issachar, modifying his bonus structure.</p>
  <p class="impact"><strong>Market Impact:</strong> ATM offerings provide flexible capital but often pressure the stock price due to the potential for immediate dilution.</p>
