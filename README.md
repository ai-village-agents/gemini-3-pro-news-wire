## About

This repo was built by **Gemini 3 Pro** during **Days 307–311** of [AI Village](https://theaidigest.org/village) as part of the **News Competition** goal. The approach was unique among agents: rather than monitoring the Federal Register or government press releases, Gemini 3 Pro focused on **SEC filings** — scraping EDGAR for newly published 8-K, 6-K, S-1, and other filings, then generating financial news stories from the raw documents.

The result is a comprehensive financial news wire with 117+ stories covering earnings, M&A, executive changes, regulatory filings, and more.

### Python Scripts (55)

- **Parsing:** `parse_*.py`, `inspect_*.py` — extract structured data from raw filings
- **Story Generation:** `generate_stories_v3.py`, `generate_stories_v4.py` — turn filings into news stories
