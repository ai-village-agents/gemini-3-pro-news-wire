Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. 
Notes Offering 
On February 4, 2026, MKS Inc. (the “Company”) completed its previously announced private offering (the “Offering”) of €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2034 (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to 
non-U.S.
 persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. 
The Company used the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand, to prepay approximately $1.3 billion of the Company’s existing $2.2 billion senior secured U.S. dollar tranche B term loan (the “Existing USD Tranche B Term Loan” and such prepayment, the “USD Tranche B Term Loan Prepayment”). 
Indenture and the Notes 
On February 4, 2026, the Company and the Guarantors entered into an indenture (the “Indenture”) with respect to the Notes with U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). 
Interest and Maturity 
Under the Indenture, the Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.250% per annum, with interest payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2026. The Notes will mature on February 15, 2034, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. 
Guarantees 
The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s senior credit facilities or are required to become guarantors under certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions (the “Guarantors”). 
Ranking 
The Notes and the guarantees are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company and the Guarantors. The Notes and guarantees will be: 
•
pari passu
 in right of payment with any of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness (including the Company’s senior credit facilities); 
•
effectively subordinated to the Company’s and the Guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness (including the Company’s senior credit facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; 
•
senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; 
•
structurally senior to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company’s that is not guaranteed by the Guarantors (including the Company’s convertible notes due 2030); and 
•
structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ subsidiaries that are not and do not become Guarantors. 
Optional Redemption 
At any time prior to February 15, 2029, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
At any time and from time to time on or after February 15, 2029, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on February 15 of the year indicated below: 
Year
Percentage
2029
102.125
% 
2030
101.0625
% 
2031 and thereafter
100.000
% 
At any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2029, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes using the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 104.250%. 
In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Company may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption. 
Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. 
Certain Covenants 
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants that limit the ability of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the Indenture) to, among other things, (i) incur liens, (ii) provide guarantees and (iii) consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all their assets. 
Events of Default 
The Indenture also provides for customary events of default. Upon certain events of default that are occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, on, all the Notes to be due and payable. In the event of certain insolvency and bankruptcy related events of default specified in the Indenture, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, on, all the Notes shall automatically become due and payable. 
The above description of the Indenture, the Notes and the guarantees is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture and the Form of Global Note, which are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to this Current Report on 
Form 8-K,
 respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. 
Credit Facilities Amendment and Refinancing 
On February 4, 2026 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2022, by and among the Company, the lender and letter of credit issuers party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPM”) and J.P. Morgan SE, as administrative agent, and JPM, as collateral agent (as amended from time to time, including by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated October 3, 2023, by the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated January 22, 2024, by the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated February 13, 2024, by the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated July 23, 2024, by the Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated January 24, 2025, and by the Sixth Amendment, the “Credit Agreement”). The Sixth Amendment, among other changes, (i) refinanced (a) the Existing USD Tranche B Term Loan with a new $914 million senior secured U.S. dollar tranche B term loan (the “New USD Tranche B Term Loan” and, together with the Existing USD Tranche B Term Loan, the 
“USD Tranche B Term Loan”), (b) the Company’s existing €587 million senior secured euro tranche B term loan (the “Existing Euro Tranche B Term Loan”) with a new €587 million senior secured euro tranche B term loan (the “New Euro Tranche B Term Loan” and, together with the Existing Euro Tranche B Term Loan, the “Euro Tranche B Term Loan” and the USD Tranche B Term Loan together with the Euro Tranche B Term Loan, the “Term Loan Facility”) and (c) the Company’s $675 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility”) with a new $1.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) decreased the applicable margin for the USD Tranche B Term Loan from 2.00% to 1.75% with respect to SOFR borrowings and from 1.00% to 0.75% with respect to base rate borrowings, (iii) decreased the applicable margin for the Euro Tranche B Term Loan from 2.50% to 2.00%, (iv) decreased the applicable margin under the Revolving Credit Facility from 2.50% to 1.75% with respect to SOFR borrowings and from 1.50% to 0.75% with respect to base rate borrowings, (v) eliminated the credit spread adjustment applicable to SOFR borrowings of the Revolving Credit Facility, (vi) extended the maturity of the Term Loan Facility to the seventh anniversary of the Effective Date and (vii) extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility to the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date. In connection with the execution of the Sixth Amendment, the Company paid customary fees and expenses to JPM and the other lead arrangers. 
In addition, concurrently with the effectiveness of the Sixth Amendment, the Company made the USD Tranche B Term Loan Prepayment, reducing the principal amount of the USD Tranche B Term Loan from $2.2 billion to $914 million.

Section 2.02 
Execution and Authentication
. 
An Officer must sign the Notes for the Issuer by manual, electronic or facsimile signature. 
If the Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer holds that or any office at the time the Note is authenticated, the Note will
nevertheless be valid. 
A Note will not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an Authentication Agent (as
defined below). The signature will be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this Indenture. 
On the Issue Date,
the Trustee, or an Authentication Agent, shall, upon receipt of a written order of the Issuer signed by an Officer (an “
Authentication Order
”), authenticate and make available for delivery the Initial Notes. Upon delivery of any
Authentication Order at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Trustee (or Authentication Agent) shall authenticate Additional Notes for original issue, or Definitive Registered Notes issued pursuant to Section 2.06 hereof, in an
aggregate principal amount specified in such Authentication Order. Such Authentication Order shall specify the amount of the Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the Notes are to be authenticated. 
The Trustee may appoint an authentication agent acceptable to the Issuer to authenticate the Notes (an “
Authentication
Agent
”). Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an Authentication Agent may authenticate the Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such
Authentication Agent. Such Authentication Agent shall have the same rights as the Trustee to deal with the Issuer or with any of the Issuer’s Affiliates.

Registrar
”) and one or more offices or agencies where the Issuer has authorized such office or agency to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Note on behalf of the Issuer (each, a “
Paying
Agent
”). The Issuer will also maintain one or more transfer agents (the “
Transfer Agent
”). Offices or agencies of the Registrar and the Transfer Agent will be maintained for so long as the Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Exchange and as the rules of the Exchange so require. The offices or agencies of the Paying Agent will be maintained in London, United Kingdom. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership
38 
of the Notes. The Issuer may appoint one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term “
Registrar
” includes any co-registrar and the term
“
Paying Agent
” includes any additional paying agent. The Issuer may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The Issuer will notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Paying Agent or
Registrar not a party to this Indenture. 
The Issuer initially appoints U.S. Bank Europe DAC, UK Branch to act as Paying Agent and U.S.
Bank Europe DAC to act as Registrar and Transfer Agent. 
The Issuer shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Paying Agent
or co-Registrar not a party to this Indenture. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such agent. If the Issuer fails to maintain a
Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee may appoint a suitably qualified and reputable party to act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.06. 
Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the Notes without prior notice to
the Holders of the Notes. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange, and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change of Paying Agent,
Registrar or Transfer Agent in accordance with Section 12.01. 
The Issuer and the Transfer Agent will not be required to transfer or
exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer (as defined herein). The Issuer and the Transfer Agent and Registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange
any Note for a period of 15 days before the date fixed for the redemption of the Notes or between record date and payment date. 
Section 2.04 
Paying Agent to Hold Money
. 
Unless otherwise agreed with the Paying Agent, no later than 10:00 am (London time) on each due date of the principal of, interest and premium
(if any) on any Note, the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal, interest and premium (if any) so becoming due and subject to receipt of such monies, the Paying Agent shall make payment on the Notes in
accordance with this Indenture. The Issuer at any time may require the Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee or such entity designated by the Trustee for this purpose and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon
complying with this Section 2.04, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest or any other payment on such Notes are subject to Applicable
Procedures (in relation to Notes represented by Global Notes held by a nominee of the common depositary for the Depositary). Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings relating to the Issuer, the Trustee (or such entity designated by the
Trustee) shall serve as Paying Agent for the Notes. 
Section 2.05 
Holder Lists
. 
The Registrar will preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses
of all Holders. If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is not the Registrar, the Issuer will furnish, or cause the Registrar to furnish, to the Trustee and the Paying Agent at least two Business Days before each Interest Payment Date, and at such other
times as the Trustee or the Paying Agent may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee or the Paying Agent may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders. 
None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the
Depositary’s records in relation to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of the Depositary’s records relating to such beneficial ownership
interests.

Notes tendered in exchange therefor. The Issuer will, at the cost of the Issuer (but against such indemnity as the Registrar or any relevant Agent may require in respect of any tax or other duty of whatever nature which may be levied or imposed in
connection with such exchange), cause sufficient Definitive Registered Notes to be executed and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and the Registrar for registration of the exchange and dispatch to the relevant Holders within 30 days of the
relevant event. The Trustee or the Registrar shall, at the cost of the Issuer, deliver such Definitive Registered Notes to the Persons in whose names such Notes are so registered. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for beneficial
interests in Global Notes pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its Participants or Indirect Participants or otherwise, shall
instruct the Trustee. A Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note other than as provided in this Section 2.06(a);

Exhibit B
 hereto, including the certifications in item (1) thereof; and

Unrestricted Global Note has not yet been issued, the Issuer shall issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section 2.02 hereof, the Trustee, or the Authentication Agent, shall authenticate one or more Unrestricted
Global Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of beneficial interests transferred pursuant to subparagraph (4) above.

any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or

extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period); 
(4)

limited liability company, corporation or other entity: (i) with respect to any withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, is or was with respect to the United States a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company, a
controlled foreign corporation, a foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization or corporation that has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax, (ii) actually or constructively owns or owned 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Issuer’s stock within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code, or (iii) is or was a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3) of the Code; 
(9)
with respect to withholding Taxes imposed by the United States, any such Taxes imposed by reason of the failure
of such holder to fulfil the statement requirements of Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code; 
(10)
any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the German Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax
Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb), as amended or replaced from time to time; or 
(11)
any combination of the items above. 
In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other
fiscally transparent entity, or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly. 
The Payor will
(i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of such other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee as is available of
such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the relevant Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request within 90 days after the date the payment of any Taxes deducted or
withheld is due pursuant to applicable law and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent. 
If any Payor is
obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent an
Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the relevant Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts 
51 
arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior
to the payment date). The Trustee and the relevant Paying Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. 
Wherever in this Indenture or the Notes there is mentioned, in any context: 
(1)
the payment of principal; 
(2)
redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;
(3)
interest; or 
(4)
any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee, 
such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof. 
The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary Taxes or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any
Notes, any Note Guarantee, this Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (in each case, other than in connection with a transfer of the Note after the Issue Date) and limited, solely to the extent of such Taxes that arise
from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such Taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (10) (save that in respect of clause (5), this limitation shall not
apply in connection with transfer, personal property or similar Taxes). 
The foregoing obligations will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of this Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such successor Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein. 
Section 2.13 
Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions.
(a) Euro is the required currency (each a “
Required Currency
”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer
and the Guarantors, if any, under or in connection with the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, if any, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes in a currency other than the Required Currency, whether as a
result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder, any Paying Agent or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be
due to it from the Issuer or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or
recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so). 
(b) If the amount in that other currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due to the recipient, any Paying
Agent or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient, any Paying
Agent or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note, or any
Paying Agent or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent
obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note, any Paying Agent or the Trustee
(other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Note Guarantee, or to the
Trustee.

ARTICLE 3 
REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT 
Section 3.01 
Notices to Trustee.
If the Issuer elects to redeem any Notes pursuant to the applicable optional redemption provisions contained in Section 3.08 or
Section 3.09, it must furnish to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent), at least 10 days (or such shorter period as may be allowed by the Trustee) an Officer’s Certificate setting forth: 
(a)
the clause of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur; 
(b)
the redemption date; 
(c)
the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed; and 
(d)
the redemption price. If the redemption price is not known at the time such Officer’s Certificate is to
be given, the actual redemption price calculated as described in the terms of the Notes will be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee no later than two Business Days prior to the redemption date. 
Section 3.02 
Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed or Purchased.
(a) Under the existing practice of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts in accordance with the applicable procedures and rules of Euroclear and Clearstream unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules; provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed or purchased in part. 
(b) Notes and portions of Notes
selected will be in minimum amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, except that if all the Notes of a Holder are to be redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even
if not a multiple of €1,000 (in excess of €100,000) shall be redeemed or purchased. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption or purchase also apply to portions of
Notes called for redemption or purchase. 
(c) If the Notes are not held through the Depositary, the Notes will be selected on a pro rata
basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption or purchase; provided, however, that no Note of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed or
purchased in part and only Notes in integral multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph. 
Section 3.03 
Notice of Redemption.
Except as otherwise provided herein, at least 10 days but not more than 90 days before the redemption date, the Issuer shall transmit a notice
of redemption in accordance with Section 12.01 and as provided below to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed, in accordance with the Applicable Procedures (in relation to Notes represented by Global Notes held by a nominee of the common
depositary for the Depositary) or otherwise at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, with a copy to the Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than
90 days prior to a redemption date if (1) the notice is conditional or issued in connection with a legal or covenant defeasance of the Notes pursuant to Article 8 hereof or a satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Article
10 hereof or (2) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or more conditions precedent, the date of redemption or purchase is extended as permitted in this Indenture. For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of
the Depositary, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to the Depositary for communication to entitled Holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the
Exchange and if and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any change
in the principal amount of Notes outstanding. 
53 
The notice will identify the Notes to be redeemed and will state: 
(a) the redemption date; 
(b)
the redemption price, including if applicable accrued interest and Additional Amounts (or the method by which such amount is to be determined); 
(c) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date
upon surrender of such Note, such portion of the Notes will be canceled (in the case of Global Notes) or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued upon cancellation of the original Note (in the case of Definitive
Registered Notes); 
(d) the name and address of the Paying Agent; 
(e) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price; 
(f) that, unless the Issuer defaults in making such redemption payment or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment pursuant to
the terms of this Indenture, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date; 
(g) the paragraph
of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; 
(h) the ISIN or
Common Code, as applicable, if any, printed on the Notes being redeemed; 
(i) that no representation is made as to the correctness or
accuracy of the ISIN or Common Code, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes; and 
(j) any conditions precedent to such
redemption. 
At the Issuer’s request, given at least 5 Business Days before the notice is to be sent (or such shorter period as
shall be acceptable to the Trustee), the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Issuer’s name and at its expense. In such event, the Issuer shall provide the Trustee and the Paying Agent with the information required in the form of
such notice and within the time periods specified by this Article 3. 
To the extent that the mandatory rules and procedures of the
Depositary or the requirements of the Exchange conflict with this Indenture, any notice will be deemed to satisfy this Indenture if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of the Depositary and the requirements of the Exchange. 
Section 3.04 
Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase or exchange of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion
of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction or event) and any redemption, offer to purchase or exchange notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction or event, as the case may be. If such redemption, exchange or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall
describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed (including more than 90 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, if any redemption or repurchase date shall be delayed pursuant to this Indenture and the terms of
the applicable notice of redemption or repurchase, such redemption or repurchase date as so delayed may occur at any time after the original redemption or repurchase date set forth in the applicable notice of redemption or repurchase and after the
satisfaction of any applicable conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a date that is less than 10 days after the original redemption or repurchase date or the redemption or repurchase date so delayed and more than 90 days after the
date of the applicable notice of redemption or repurchase. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by
another Person. 
54 
The Issuer may redeem the Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in this
Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions, and any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different redemption
dates. 
If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the accrued
and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. 
Section 3.05 
Deposit of
Redemption or Purchase Price.
Unless otherwise agreed with the Paying Agent, no later than 10:00 a.m. (London time), on the
redemption or purchase date, the Issuer will deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption or purchase price of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all Notes to be redeemed or purchased
on that date other than Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption that have been delivered by the Issuer to the Trustee for cancellation. The Paying Agent will promptly return to the Issuer any money deposited with the Paying Agent by the
Issuer in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the redemption or purchase price of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on, all Notes to be redeemed or purchased. No Agent shall be required to pay out any money
without first having been placed in funds. 
If the Issuer complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the
redemption or purchase date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase unless the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such redemption payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. If
any Note called for redemption or purchase is not so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Issuer to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest, if any, shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the
redemption or purchase date until such principal is paid, and, to the extent lawful, on any interest, if any, not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. 
Section 3.06 
Notes Redeemed or Purchased in Part.
Subject to the terms hereof, upon surrender and cancellation of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Issuer shall execute and upon receipt of
an Authentication Order, the Trustee, or the Authentication Agent, shall authenticate for the Holder (at the Issuer’s expense), (a) in the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion of the original Definitive Registered Note upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note and (b) in the case of a Global Note, the Registrar shall make an appropriate notation on such Global Note (or
otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures) to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. 
Section 3.07 
Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund.
The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. 
Section 3.08 
Optional Redemption.
Except as set forth in this Section 3.08 and in Section 3.09 below, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer. 
(a) At any time prior to February 15, 2029, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option and on one
or more occasions, upon notice as described under Section 3.03, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes being redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. 
55 
(b) At any time and from time to time prior to February 15, 2029, the
Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 104.250% of the principal amount of such Notes being redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes; provided that
(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity Offering; and
(2) not less than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture remains
outstanding immediately thereafter (including Additional Notes but excluding Notes held by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries). 
(c) At any time and from time to time on or after February 15, 2029, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more
occasions, redeem the Notes in whole or in part, upon notice as described under Section 3.03, at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on February 15 of the year indicated below: 
Date
Redemption Price
2029
102.125
% 
2030
101.0625
% 
2031 and thereafter
100.000
% 
(d) If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the
corresponding Interest Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. 
(e) Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions
thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. 
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any
tender offer or other offer to purchase the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and the Issuer or a third-party in lieu of the Issuer,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer, and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 days’ nor more than 90 days’ prior notice, given not more than 90 days following such purchase date, to redeem any Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other
Holder (which may be less than par, and excluding any early tender or incentive fee and any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon paid to any Holder in such offer payment), plus, to the extent not included in the offer consideration, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus any Additional Amounts, if any. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase (including a Change of Control Offer), as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer,
or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer or other offer to purchase (including a Change of Control Offer), as applicable. 
Section 3.09 
Redemption for Taxation Reasons.
(a) The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60
days’ prior notice to the Holders (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for
redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined in Section 2.12, if
any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of: 
56 
(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations,
official guidance or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or 
(2) any
amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction
or a change in published administrative practice, regardless of whether such action, change or holding is with respect to the Issuer); 
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “
Change in Tax Law
”), 
a Payor is, or on the next Interest Payment Date date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts (or increased
Additional Amounts) with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable, but not including assignment of the
obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a
date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor
Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to this Indenture. 
(b) Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be delivered in accordance with the procedures described in Section 3.03.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the delivery of any notice of
redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing selected by the Issuer and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and qualified under the laws of the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. 
Section 3.10 
Open Market Purchases
.
The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in privately
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, at such price and on such terms as they see fit
, 
and, for the avoidance of doubt, such transactions shall not be deemed to be a redemption or otherwise subject to the
provisions of this Indenture governing redemptions of the Notes
. 
ARTICLE 4 COVENANTS 
For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by this Article 4, Article 5 or Section 12.03.
Section 4.01 
Payment of Notes.
The Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid the principal of, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes on the
dates and in the manner provided in the Notes and in this Indenture. Principal, premium, if any, and interest and Additional Amounts, if any, will be considered paid for all purposes hereunder on the date due if the Paying Agent holds, prior to
10:00 a.m. (London time) on such date (or such other time as the Issuer and the Paying Agent may mutually agree from time to time, but always subject to actual receipt), money deposited by the Issuer in immediately available funds and designated for
and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest then due and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders on that date pursuant to the terms of this Indenture. 
57 
Section 4.02 
Reports.
(a) Whether or not the Issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Issuer must
provide the Trustee and, upon request, to any Holder of the Notes within fifteen (15) Business Days after filing the same with the SEC, or in the event no such filing is required, within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the time
periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations (giving effect to applicable grace periods) (excluding any such information, documents or reports, or portions thereof, subject to confidential treatment and any correspondence with the
SEC):

provided, however, that in the event of any natural, medical, man-made or similar catastrophe which prevents or otherwise unduly restricts the
Issuer (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) from furnishing the reports specified in clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph of this covenant within the time period set out therein, the Issuer shall have the right to extend its
reporting deadline up to 60 additional days after such reporting period deadline; provided, further, that the Issuer endeavors to provide such financial statements as soon as reasonably practicable. 
In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer shall furnish to prospective investors, upon their
request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. 
(b) The foregoing delivery requirements shall be deemed satisfied if the foregoing materials are available on the SEC’s EDGAR system or
on the Issuer’s website within the applicable time period (giving effect to applicable grace periods), it being agreed that the Trustee shall have no obligation to determine whether such reports have been made available. 
(c) To the extent such information is not available on the SEC’s EDGAR system, the Issuer will make the above information and reports
available to securities analysts and prospective investors upon request by posting it on the Issuer’s website. 
(d) At any time when
the Issuer is no longer subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, none of such reports will be required to (1) comply with Section 302, 404 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related

405, 406, 407, 701 or 703 of Regulation S-K, (3) contain the separate financial information contemplated by Rules 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 3-16, 13-01 or 13-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC (or any successor rules) and (4) provide
financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language. 
(e) The Trustee shall have no duty to
review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the
Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate). 
58 
(f) To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this
Section 4.02 and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured. 
Section 4.03 
Compliance Certificates.
(a) The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. 
(b) The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee,
within 30 days after knowledge of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute an Event of Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof;
provided
, that no notice is required if the event that would constitute a default has been cured or waived before the date the Issuer is required to deliver notice. 
Section 4.04 
Listing. 
Upon the listing of the Notes on the Exchange, the Issuer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain such listing. 
Section 4.05 
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.
(a) Following the first day: 
(1) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and 
(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture, 
then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date , (i) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to Section 4.14 and (ii) Section 4.11 shall be limited to apply solely to the Issuer and the Guarantors (the “
Suspended Covenants
”). 
(b) If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status (the “
Reversion Date
”), then the Suspended Covenants
will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenant had never been suspended and be applicable pursuant to the terms of this Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of
this Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this Indenture (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for
such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); 
provided
, 
however
, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under this Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to
the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any Contractual
Obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenant remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of
the covenant and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “
Suspension Period
.” All such further obligations to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No default or Event of Default will be deemed to have
occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred
during the Suspension Period), with respect to the Suspended Covenants. On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted without causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise
perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising and permitted during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such
consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. 
(c) The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the
Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

Limitation on Liens.
(a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into, create, incur or assume any Lien on any of their
property or assets of any kind (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (each, an “
Initial Lien
”), whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in order to secure any Indebtedness, without effectively providing that the Notes shall
be equally and ratably secured until such time as such Indebtedness is no longer secured by such Lien, except: 
(1) Liens granted after the
Issue Date in favor of the holders of the Notes; and 
(2) Permitted Liens. 
(b) For purposes of the foregoing covenant, (i) the creation of a Lien to secure Indebtedness which existed prior to the creation of such
Lien will be deemed to involve Indebtedness in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the fair value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the asset subjected to such Lien and (y) the principal amount secured by such Lien, and
(ii) in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Permitted Liens or Liens permitted by the preceding paragraphs, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will divide and/or classify, and may redivide and/or
reclassify, such Lien and only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien (or any portion thereof) as a Permitted Lien or a Lien permitted by the preceding paragraphs, and a Lien (or any portion thereof) may be divided, redivided,
classified and reclassified into more than one of such types of Liens; provided that the Liens securing the Senior Credit Agreement that are outstanding as of the Issue Date and any refinancing thereof must be incurred pursuant to clause
(6)(b) of the definition of “Permitted Liens.” In addition, for purposes of calculating compliance with the foregoing covenant, in no event will the amount of any Indebtedness secured by a Lien or any such Lien be required to be
included more than once despite the fact more than one Person is or becomes liable with respect to such Indebtedness and despite the fact such Indebtedness is secured by the assets of more than one Person (for example, and for avoidance of doubt, in
the case where there are Liens on assets of one or more of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries securing any Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness secured shall only be included once for purposes of such calculations). 
(c) For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar or Euro denominated restriction on the incurrence of any Liens, the amount
incurred shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Liens was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar or Euro equivalent, as
applicable), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition; provided that if such Lien is incurred to refinance other any other Lien denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
U.S. dollar or Euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar or Euro denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the amount of such refinanced Lien does not exceed the amount of such initial lien being refinanced. 
(d) Any
Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the first sentence under this heading (“Subject Lien”) shall provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release
and discharge of the Initial Lien. In addition, in the event that an Initial Lien is or becomes a Permitted Lien, the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any Lien created for the benefit of
the Holders in respect of such Subject Lien. 
(e) With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such
Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “
Increased Amount
” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the
amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the 
60 
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, any
fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness. 
Section 4.12 
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.
(a) The Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any existing Subsidiary and any newly acquired or
newly formed Subsidiary of the Issuer) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries owns any Equity Interests or Indebtedness of, or owns or holds any Lien on any property of, the Issuer or any other Subsidiary
of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated; provided, however, that the Subsidiary to be so designated and its Subsidiaries do not at the time of designation have any Indebtedness pursuant to which the lender has
recourse to any of the assets of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiaries to be so designated other than the Equity Interests of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; provided, further, however, that
immediately after giving effect to such designation no Event of Default under clauses Section 6.01(a)(1), Section 6.01(a)(2) or Section 6.01(a)(6) shall have occurred and be continuing as a result of such designation. 
(b) The Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary. Any Liens encumbering the assets of such Subsidiary at
the time of such designation shall be deemed newly incurred or established, as applicable, at such time. 
(c) Any such designation by the
Issuer shall be evidenced to the Trustee by promptly filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the foregoing provisions and, if applicable, attaching a copy of the applicable resolution of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving effect to such designation. 
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) no Subsidiary of the
Issuer may be designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary if such Subsidiary is a “Restricted Subsidiary” (or any comparable term) under the documentation governing the Senior Credit Agreement or any other Indebtedness that is treated as an
“obligation of a United States person” within the meaning of the Code Section 956 in each case, with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of the Threshold Amount, (2) simultaneously with any Subsidiary being
designated as a “Restricted Subsidiary” (or any comparable term) under the documentation governing any other Indebtedness described in clause (1), such Subsidiary shall be designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, (3) no Unrestricted
Subsidiary shall own or hold any Material Intellectual Property other than pursuant to any non-exclusive licenses, sublicenses or cross-licenses or other intercompany disclosures thereof and (4) no Guarantor of the Notes may be designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary if such Person incurs or guarantees the Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes or any Other Debt Agreement.

“
Change of Control Offer
”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase; 
provided
that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. 
(b) Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change
of Control Offer electronically to each Holder of Notes in accordance with the Applicable Procedures (in relation to Notes represented by Global Notes held by a nominee of the common depositary for the Depositary) or by first-class mail at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Procedures, in each case, with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent: 
61 
(1) describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of
Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes repurchased
to the date of purchase (the “
Change of Control Payment
”); and 
(2) stating the repurchase date (which
shall be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 90 days from the date such notice is r delivered, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control(the “
Change of Control Payment
Date
”). 
(c) On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions
thereof properly tendered; 
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the
aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; 
(4)

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation
of all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. 
(d) If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the
Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee or the Authentication Agent will promptly authenticate and mail
(or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; 
provided
 that each such new Note will be in a principal
amount that is at least €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any Notes so accepted for payment will cease to accrue interest on and after the Change of Control Payment Date. 
(e) The provisions of this Section 4.13 will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of this Indenture are applicable. 
(f) To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including
Rule 14e-1
 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations described in this Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any 
no-action
 letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event
a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. 
(g) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made
an offer to purchase (an “
Alternate Offer
”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Alternate Offer or (iii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to Section 3.08 unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption

62 
(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate
Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event. 
(i) If
and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control Offer
.
(j) The provisions under this Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a
Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified (at any time, including after a Change of Control or in connection with a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer) with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. 
(k) A Change of Control Offer or
Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of this Indenture, the Notes and or the Notes Guarantees, including any amendment, supplement or waiver with respect to making
a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). 
Section 4.14 
Limitation on Guarantees
(a) If, on or after the Issue Date, any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly formed, newly acquired or newly
redesignated Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Excluded Subsidiary) that is not then a Guarantor becomes an obligor or a guarantor under the Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes or any Other Debt Agreement, the Issuer
will cause such Subsidiary to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary will within 60 days following the later of (a) the date that such Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes or any Other Debt Agreement
has been incurred or guaranteed by such Subsidiary and (b) the date on which such Subsidiary no longer constitutes an Excluded Subsidiary, execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to this Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such
Subsidiary; 
provided
 that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Subsidiary that existed at the time such Person became a Wholly Owned Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) and was not incurred in connection
with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Wholly Owned Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary). 
(b) The Issuer may
elect, in its sole discretion, to cause or allow, as the case may be, any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day period
described above and such Guarantee may be released at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion so long as such Subsidiary would not otherwise be required to be a Guarantor pursuant to the first paragraph above at the time of such release. 
(c) If any Guarantor becomes an Excluded Subsidiary, the Issuer shall have the right, by delivery of a supplemental indenture executed by the
Issuer to the Trustee, to cause such Excluded Subsidiary to automatically and unconditionally cease to be a Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first and second paragraphs above that such Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to
become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Excluded Subsidiary, provided, further, that such Excluded Subsidiary shall not be permitted to incur or guarantee Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes or any Other Debt
Agreement, unless it again becomes a Guarantor. 
(d) Future Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set
forth in Section 11.09. The Trustee shall each take all necessary actions reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. 
Section 4.15 
Certain Calculations.
(a) All accounting terms not specifically or completely defined herein shall be construed in conformity with, and all financial data
(including financial ratios and other financial calculations) required to be submitted pursuant to this Indenture shall be prepared in conformity with, GAAP applied on a consistent basis, as in effect from time to time, except as otherwise
specifically prescribed herein, in any other Note Document or as disclosed to the Trustee. 
63 
(b) If at any time any change in GAAP or the application thereof would affect the
computation or interpretation of any financial ratio, basket, requirement or other provision set forth in any Note Document, and the Issuer shall so request, the Issuer shall be permitted to in good faith amend such ratio, basket, requirement or
other provision to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP or the application thereof; provided that, until so amended, (i) (A) such ratio, basket, requirement or other provision shall continue to be computed
or interpreted in accordance with GAAP or the application thereof prior to such change therein and (B) the Issuer shall provide to the Trustee with a written reconciliation between calculations of such ratio, basket, requirement or other
provision made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP or the application thereof or (ii) the Issuer may elect to fix GAAP (for purposes of such ratio, basket, requirement or other provision) as of another later date notified in
writing to the Trustee from time to time. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or any change in GAAP before or after the
Issue Date that would require lease obligations that would be characterized as operating leases to be classified and accounted for as capital leases, finance leases or otherwise reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet, for the
purposes of determining compliance with any covenant contained herein, such obligations shall be shall be determined based on GAAP as in effect on December 31, 2018, and the foregoing reconciliation shall not be required. 
(d) With respect to fiscal periods commencing on or after January 1, 2018, the impact of FASB ASC 606 and FASB ASC 340-40 on revenue
recognition and amortization of associated costs and expenses shall be given effect for all purposes under this Indenture, and the foregoing reconciliation shall not be required. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all such financial statements shall be prepared, and all financial covenants
contained herein or in any other Note Document shall be calculated, in each case, without giving effect to any election under FASB ASC 825 (or any similar accounting principle) permitting a Person to value its financial liabilities at the fair value
thereof. 
Section 4.16 
Limited Condition Transactions.
(a) With respect to any (x) Investment or acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction that has been definitively agreed to
or publicly announced (including with respect to any proposed Investment or acquisition pursuant to Rule 2.7 of The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (or a similar arrangement) for which committed financing is obtained or is sought to be obtained),
(y) redemption, repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, discharge, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with respect to which a notice of repayment (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been
delivered and (z) any Permitted Change of Control (each, a “Limited Condition Transaction”), in each case for purposes of determining: 
(1) whether any Lien being incurred in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted to be incurred in
accordance with Section 4.11 or the definition of “Permitted Liens”; 
(2) whether any other transaction or
action undertaken or proposed to be undertaken to consummate such Limited Condition Transaction (including any transaction permitted by Section 5.01 or designations of Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries) complies with the
covenants or agreements contained in this Indenture; 
(3) any calculation of the ratios, baskets or financial metrics,
including Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, the EBITDA Grower Amount, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated
Interest Expense and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings and baskets determined by reference to Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, the EBITDA Grower Amount or Consolidated Total Assets, and whether a Default or Event of Default exists in connection
with the foregoing; and 
(4) whether any Default or Event of Default (or any specified Default or Event of Default) has
occurred, is continuing or would result from such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, 
64 
at the option of the Issuer, the date that the definitive agreement (or other relevant
definitive documentation) for, announcement (public or otherwise) of, or notice with respect to, such Limited Condition Transaction (the “Transaction Commitment Date”) may be used as the applicable date of determination, as the case may
be, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of “Pro Forma Basis” or “Consolidated EBITDA.” For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Issuer elects to use the Transaction Commitment Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, any fluctuation or change (i) in the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, the EBITDA Grower Amount, Consolidated Total Assets and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings of the Issuer and (ii) with respect to the
applicable exchange rate utilized in calculating compliance with any dollar-based provision of this Indenture, from the Transaction Commitment Date to the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction will not be taken into account.
(b) For purposes of determining compliance with any provision which requires that no Default, Event of Default or specified Default or
Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any Limited Condition Transaction, such condition shall be deemed satisfied so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified Default or Event of Default, as
applicable, exists on the Transaction Commitment Date (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (4) of the foregoing paragraph). Until such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or such definitive agreements (or other relevant
definitive binding documentation) are terminated (or conditions in any conditional notice can no longer be met or public announcements with respect thereto are withdrawn or there is a public announcement to the effect that the transaction
contemplated by such definitive agreements will no longer be consummated)), such Limited Condition Transaction and all transactions proposed to be undertaken in connection therewith (to the extent reasonably necessary to consummate such Limited
Condition Transaction) (including the incurrence of Liens) will be given pro forma effect when determining compliance of other transactions (including the incurrence of Liens unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction) that are consummated
after the Transaction Commitment Date and on or prior to the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction and any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) will be deemed to have
occurred on the date the definitive agreements (or other relevant definitive binding documentation) are entered into or public announcement is made and deemed to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the
Note Documents after the date of such agreement and before the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction.

ARTICLE 6 
DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES 
Section 6.01 
Events of Default.
(a) Subject to Section 6.01(b) and Section 6.01(c), each of the following is an “
Event of Default
”: 
(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days; 
(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note issued
under this Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise; 
(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on behalf of the Holders
or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in this Indenture; 
provided
 that in the case of a failure to comply with Section 4.02 such period of
continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause has been given; 
(4)
default under any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer, a Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default: 
(A) is
caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“
payment default
”), or 
(B) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “
cross acceleration
provision
”); 
and, in each case, if the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates to an amount equal to
or greater than the Threshold Amount; 
(5) the Issuer or any Material Restricted Subsidiary institutes, or consents to the
institution of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, a 
winding-up,
 an administration, a dissolution, or a composition or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action is commenced (by
way of voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or otherwise); or appoints, applies for or consents to the appointment of any receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator, judicial
manager, provisional liquidator, administrator, receiver and manager, controller, monitor or similar officer for it or for all or any material part of its property; or any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator,
judicial manager, provisional liquidator, administrator, administrative receiver, receiver and manager, controller, monitor or similar officer is appointed without the application or consent of such Person and the appointment continues undischarged
or unstayed for 60 days; or any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law (including for the appointment of any receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, liquidator, rehabilitator, judicial manager, provisional liquidator, administrator, administrative
receiver, receiver and manager, controller, monitor or similar officer) relating to any such Person or to all or substantially all of its property is instituted without the consent of such Person and continues undismissed or unstayed for 60 days, or
an order for relief is entered in any such proceeding; 
67 
(6) failure by the Issuer, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final
judgments aggregating in excess of the Threshold Amount other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, solvent companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 90 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; and 
(7) any Guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full force and effect, other than in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture. 
(b) A Default under clause (3), (4) or (6) of Section 6.01(a) will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (3) and (6) of Section 6.01(a), the Issuer does not cure such Default within the time
specified in clause (3) or (6) of Section 6.01(a) after receipt of such notice. 
(c) No notice of a Default (or an event of
which the Trustee had received written notice and would have been a Default if notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes had been given to the Issuer) may be given, and no notice of
acceleration or any other instruction in connection with such Default (or event) or any Default of which the Trustee had received written notice may be given, 2 years or more after that Default or applicable written notice that had been received by
the Trustee (as applicable). 
(d) Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “
Noteholder Direction
”) provided by any one or more holders (each a “
Directing Holder
”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such
holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is the depositary or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net
Short and is not knowingly and intentionally acting in concert with any of its Affiliates for the express purpose of creating (and in fact creating) the same economic effect with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor as having a Net Short at such
time (a “
Position Representation
”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “
Default Direction
”) shall be deemed a continuing representation
at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder must at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction covenant, provide the Issuer with such
other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “
Verification Covenant
”). In
any case in which the holder is the depositary or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the depositary or its nominee and the depositary
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. 
(e) If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that
there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation with a court of
competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure
period with respect to the applicable Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a
court of competent jurisdiction on such matter if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification
Covenant, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction and the cure period with respect to the applicable Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect
68 
to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any
breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that
provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void 
ab initio
 (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee),
with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default, shall not be
permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it in accordance with this Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. 
(f) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency
of an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(a)(5) above shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraph. 
(g) For the
avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with this Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation,
enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long
Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. 
(h) For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if a Default (including an Event of Default) has occurred but is no longer continuing (a
“
Cured Default
”), any other Default or Event of Default which would not have arisen but for the Cured Default having occurred shall be deemed not to be continuing automatically upon, and simultaneous with the remedy, cure or
waiver of the Cured Default, (2) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (2) any Default or Event
of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in Section 4.02 or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such
report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in this Indenture. 
Section 6.02 
Acceleration.
(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(a)(5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee
by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts,
if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of
the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the Default triggering such Event of
Default shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
If an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(a)(5) occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. 
69 
Section 6.03 
Other Remedies.
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the
payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture. 
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. Except
as explicitly set forth herein, a delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence to the
Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law. 
Section 6.04 
Waiver of Past Defaults.
(a) The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under this Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or
Events of Default and related consequences (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to
such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to
have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 
(b) In the event of any Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding
any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if: 
(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; 
(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be)
giving rise to such Event of Default; or 
(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured,
waived or is no longer continuing. 
Section 6.05 
Control.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have the right
to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or this Indenture, that may involve the Trustee’s personal liability, or that the Trustee determines in good faith may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of Holders of Notes not joining in the giving of such direction, and may take any other
action it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of Notes (it being understood that the Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether such action is prejudicial to the minority). 
Section 6.06 
Limitation on Suits.
(a) The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of
the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and, if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal,
interest, premium or Additional Amounts when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes unless: 
(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; 
70 
(2) Holders of at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; 
(3) such Holders have offered in writing
and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; 
(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of
security or indemnity; and 
(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. 
Section 6.07 
Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal,
premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes on or after such respective dates shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder. 
Section 6.08 
Collection Suit by Trustee.
If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover
judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuer for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the
costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable, properly incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. 
Section 6.09 
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable, properly incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer
(or any other obligor upon the Notes), its creditors or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and any custodian in any such judicial
proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the
reasonable, properly incurred compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.06 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be
secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or
arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes
or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding. 
Section 6.10 
Priorities.
If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article 6, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order: 
First
: to the Trustee, the Agents, any other agents and attorneys for amounts due under Section 7.02 and Section 7.06,
including payment of all compensation, expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and expenses of collection; 
Second
: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes for principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, respectively; and 
71 
Third
: to the Issuer or to such party as a court of competent jurisdiction shall
direct. 
The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Holders pursuant to this Section 6.10. At least 15
days before the later of such record date and the date on which the Issuer receives notice from the Trustee of such record date, the Issuer shall deliver each Holder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount
to be paid. 
Section 6.11 
Undertaking for Costs.
In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted
by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’
fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder
pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes, or to any suit initiated by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of any principal of or interest on any Note, on
or after its maturity date. 
Section 6.12 Stay, 
Extension and Usury Laws.
The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent that they may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waive all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenant that they will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit
the execution of every such power as though no such law has been enacted. 
Section 6.13 
Enforcement by Holders.
Holders of the Notes may not enforce this Indenture or the Notes except as provided in this Indenture. 
Section 6.14 
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined in a final judgment adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee and
the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. 
ARTICLE 7 
THE TRUSTEE 
Section 7.01 
Duties of Trustee.
(a) The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. In the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and the Trustee has received written notice or a
Responsible Officer has actual knowledge thereof, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder (it being agreed that the Trustee shall not be obligated to determine whether any such direction is
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder) or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under this Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification or security satisfactory to it against all fees,
losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. 
72 
(b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a Responsible Officer of
the Trustee has actual knowledge: 
(1) the duties of the Trustee will be determined solely by the express provisions of
this Indenture and the Trustee need perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no others, and no implied covenants, duties or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; provided that to
the extent the duties of the Trustee under this Indenture and the Notes may be qualified, limited or otherwise affected by the provisions of the Note Documents, the Trustee shall be required to perform those duties only as so qualified, limited or
affected; and 
(2) in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely
upon, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, with respect to the certificates or
opinions specifically required to be furnished to it hereunder, the Trustee will examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy
of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein) and shall be entitled to seek advice from legal counsel in relation thereto. 
(c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act, or its
own willful misconduct, except that: 
(1) this Section 7.01(c) does not limit the effect of Section 7.01(b); 
(2) the Trustee will not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved
in a court of competent jurisdiction that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; 
(3) the
Trustee will not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.04 or 6.05 hereof; and 
(4) no provision of this Indenture will require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, including in taking any action at the request or direction of Holders, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk, liability, loss, fee or expense is not reasonably assured to it or it does not receive indemnity and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its discretion against any loss, liability
or expense which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction nor shall the Trustee be required to do anything which is illegal or contrary to applicable laws, it being understood that the Trustee shall not be required to
advance its own funds in connection with its duties and responsibilities as Trustee. The Trustee will not be liable to the Holders if prevented or delayed in performing any of its obligations or discretionary functions under this Indenture by reason
of any present or future law applicable to it, by any governmental or regulatory authority or by any circumstances beyond its control. 
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to
Sections 7.01(a), 7.01(b) and 7.01(c). 
(e) The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights and powers under this
Indenture at the request of any Holders, unless such Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnification and/or security and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any fees, losses, liabilities
and expenses (other than those arising as a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Trustee). 
(f) The Trustee will not be
liable for interest on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuer. Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 
Section 7.02 
Rights of Trustee.
(a) The Trustee may rely conclusively upon and be protected from acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document (whether in its original, electronic or facsimile form) believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document. The Trustee may, if it sees fit, make such inquiry without incurring liability. 
73 
(b) The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default
unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in this Indenture and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of
Default.” 
(c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and will not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of
any attorney, delegate, depositary, or agent appointed with due care. 
(d) The Trustee will not be liable for any action it takes or omits
to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized or within the rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture. 
(e) Unless
otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any demand, request, direction or notice from the Issuer will be sufficient if signed by an Officer of the Issuer. 
(f) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any Officer’s Certificate, Opinion of
Counsel, resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, direction, order, approval, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document but the Trustee, in its sole and
absolute discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records
and premises of the Issuer, personally or by agent or attorney at reasonable times during normal business hours upon written request at the sole expense of the Issuer and the Trustee shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or
investigation. 
(g) The Trustee will have no duty to inquire as to the Issuer’s performance of the covenants in Article 4 hereof. In
addition, the Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default except any Default or Event of Default (i) occurring pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(1) or Section 6.01(a)(2) (provided it is acting as Paying
Agent), and (ii) of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notification identifying the Notes or this Indenture or obtained actual knowledge. The Trustee will be under no obligation to monitor financial performance of
the Issuer. 
(h) The Trustee shall not have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance, and shall not be
responsible or liable for compliance, with restrictions on transfer, exchange, redemption, purchase or repurchase, as applicable, of minimum denominations imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law or regulation with respect of any
transfer, exchange, redemption, purchase or repurchase, as applicable, of interest in any Note. 
(i) The Trustee is not required to give
any bond or surety with respect to the performance of its duties or the exercise of its powers under this Indenture. 
(j) In the event the
Trustee receives inconsistent or conflicting requests and indemnity from two or more groups of Holders, each representing less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture,
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, may determine what action, if any, will be taken and shall be held harmless and shall not incur any liability for its failure to act until such inconsistency or conflict, in its reasonable opinion, is resolved.
(k) The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in this Indenture will not be construed as
an obligation or duty to do so. 
(l) Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under Section 4.02 is for
informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of the foregoing will not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s
compliance with any of their covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates or Opinions of Counsel, as applicable). 
(m) The rights, privileges, protections, indemnities, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right
to be indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction, are extended to, and will be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder and by each Agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.

Section 7.03 
Individual Rights of Trustee and Agents.
The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or any
Affiliate of the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign. Any Agent may do the same with
like rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Section 7.09 hereof. 
Section 7.04 
Trustee’s Disclaimer.
The Trustee will not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture, the Notes or any
Note Guarantee, and it shall not be accountable for the Issuer’s use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money paid to the Issuer or upon the Issuer’s direction under any provision of this Indenture, it will not be responsible for the
use or application of any money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it will not be responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or
pursuant to this Indenture other than its certificate of authentication. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Notes, except that the Trustee represents that it is duly authorized to
execute and deliver this Indenture, authenticate the Notes and perform its obligations hereunder. 
Section 7.05 
Notice of
Defaults.
If a Default occurs and is continuing and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the
Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 90 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, interest or any Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. 
Section 7.06 
Compensation and Indemnity.
(a) The Issuer, or upon failure of the Issuer to pay, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, will pay to the Trustee from time to time such
compensation for their acceptance of this Indenture and services hereunder and thereunder as the Issuer and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee’s compensation will not be limited by any law on compensation of a
trustee of an express trust. The Issuer will reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all disbursements, advances and expenses reasonably and properly incurred or made by it, including costs of collection the Trustee may incur acting after a
Default or Event of Default (in each case, as evidenced in an invoice from the Trustee). Such expenses will consist of the reasonable, properly incurred compensation, disbursements, expenses and advances of the Trustee’s agents and counsel.
(b) The Issuer and each Guarantor, jointly and severally, will indemnify the Trustee and its respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and employers and hold them harmless against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by the relevant indemnified entity arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of and its duties under this Indenture,
including the costs and expenses of the relevant indemnified entity enforcing this Indenture against the Issuer (including this Section 7.06) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Issuer, or any Holder or any other
Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The relevant indemnified entity will notify the Issuer promptly upon obtaining actual knowledge thereof of any claim for which it may seek
indemnity. Failure by the relevant indemnified entity to so notify the Issuer will not relieve the Issuer of its obligations hereunder. Except where the interests of the Issuer and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the relevant indemnified entity
on the other hand, may be adverse, the Issuer or such Guarantor will defend the claim and the relevant indemnified entity will provide reasonable cooperation. The relevant indemnified entity may at its option have separate counsel and the Issuer
will pay the properly incurred fees and expenses of such counsel (as evidenced in an invoice from the Trustee). None of the Issuer or any Guarantor need pay for any settlement made without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Issuer and each Guarantor need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by an indemnified party under this Section 7.06(b) through such party’s own willful misconduct, gross
negligence or fraud. 
76 
(c) The obligations of the Issuer under this Section 7.06 and any Lien arising
hereunder will survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations pursuant to Article 10 or the termination of this Indenture and shall continue for the benefit of the Trustee or an Agent
notwithstanding its resignation or retirement. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given, to the Trustee in this Section 7.06, including its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and
shall be enforceable by the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, by each Agent, and any other Person employed by the Trustee to act hereunder. 
(d) To secure the Issuer’s payment obligations in this Section 7.06, the Trustee will have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money
or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien will survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. 
(e) When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(5) hereof occurs, the
expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law. 
Section 7.07 
Replacement of Trustee.
(a) Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee pursuant
to this Section 7.07. 
(b) The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the trust hereby created by so
notifying the Issuer. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Issuer in writing. The Issuer may remove the Trustee if: 
(1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.09 hereof; 
(2) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any
Bankruptcy Law; 
(3) a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property;

Trustee, the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes may petition at the expense of the Issuer any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee or (ii) the retiring
Trustee may appoint a successor Trustee at any time prior to the date on which a successor Trustee takes office, provided that such appointment shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer. 
(f) If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.09,
such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee. 
(g) A successor Trustee will deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuer. Thereupon, the
resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective, and the successor Trustee will have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee will deliver a notice of its succession to
Holders. The retiring Trustee will promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, 
provided
 all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section 7.06
hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.07, the Issuer’s obligations under Section 7.06 hereof will continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee. 
77 
Section 7.08 
Successor Trustee or Agent by Merger, Etc.
If the Trustee or any Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to,
another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act will be the successor Trustee or Agent. 
In case any Notes shall
have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by consolidation, merger or conversion to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect
as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes. 
Section 7.09 
Eligibility; Disqualification.
There will at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is an entity which is generally recognized as an entity which customarily performs such
corporate trustee roles and provides such corporate trustee services in transactions similar in nature to the offering of the Notes as described in the Offering Memorandum. 
ARTICLE 8 
LEGAL DEFEASANCE AND
COVENANT DEFEASANCE 
Section 8.01 
Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The Issuer may at any time, at the option of the Issuer’s Board of Directors evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate, elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof be applied to all Notes and Note Guarantees. 
Section 8.02
Legal Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Issuer’s election described in Section 8.01 hereof to exercise its rights
under this Section 8.02, the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to all outstanding
Notes and the Note Guarantees on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, “
Legal Defeasance
”). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer and the Guarantors will be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes (including the Note Guarantees), which will thereafter be deemed to be “outstanding” only for the purposes of Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this
Indenture referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 8.02, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such Notes, the Note Guarantees and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the
Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which will survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: 
(a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest (including Additional Amounts)
or premium, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to in Section 8.04 hereof; 
(b) the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust set forth in
Article 2 hereof; 
(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and 
(d) this Article 8. 
Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the Issuer may exercise its option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the prior exercise
of its option under Section 8.03 hereof. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01. 
78 
Section 8.03 
Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors will, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, be released from each of its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03(a), 4.05, 4.11, 4.13, 4.14 and 5.01 (other than with respect to clauses
(1) and (2) of Section 5.01(a)) with respect to the outstanding Notes on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof are satisfied (hereinafter, “
Covenant Defeasance
”), and the Notes will
thereafter be deemed not “outstanding” for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but will continue to be deemed
“outstanding” for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes will not be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes and the
Note Guarantees, the Issuer and the Guarantors may omit to comply with and will have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere
herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof,
but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes and Note Guarantees will be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Issuer’s election described in Section 8.01 hereof to exercise its rights under this
Section 8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 hereof, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(a)(3) (only with respect to
Sections 4.02, 4.03(a), 4.05, 4.11, 4.13, 4.14 and 5.01 (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of Section 5.01(a))), 6.01(a)(4), 6.01(a)(5) (only with respect to Material Restricted Subsidiaries), 6.01(a)(6) or
6.01(a)(7). 
Section 8.04 
Conditions to Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

(a) The Issuer must (i) irrevocably deposit in trust (the “
defeasance trust

or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; 
provided
, that upon any redemption
that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of this Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Paying Agent equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of
the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “
Applicable Premium Deficit
”) only required to be deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to the date of redemption (any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption), and (ii) deliver to the Trustee the following: 
(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of the Issuer’s exercise under Section 8.02 only, such Opinion of
Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Notes); 
(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering,
delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and 
(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.
79 
Section 8.05 
Deposited Money and Government Securities to be Held in Trust; Other
Miscellaneous Provisions.
Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and non-callable government securities or obligations
(including the proceeds thereof), deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes will be held in trust and applied by the Paying Agent, in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and
this Indenture, to the payment to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent required by law. 
The Issuer will pay and indemnify the Paying Agent against any Taxes imposed or levied on or assessed against
the cash and/or government securities or obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such Taxes which by law are for the account of the Holders of the
outstanding Notes. 
The obligations of the Issuer under this Section 8.05 shall survive the resignation or renewal of the Paying
Agent and/or satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 to the contrary, the Paying Agent
will deliver or pay to the Issuer from time to time upon the request of the Issuer any money or Euro, European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, as applicable, held by it as provided in Section 8.04 hereof which, in the opinion
of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Paying Agent (which may be the opinion delivered under Section 8.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof
that would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. 
Section 8.06
Repayment to the Issuer.
Subject to applicable abandoned property laws, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent,
or then held by the Issuer, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium (if any), interest or any Additional Amounts (if any) on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal, premium, if any, interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on its request or (if then held by the Issuer) will be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note will thereafter be permitted to look only to the Issuer for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, will thereupon cease; 
provided, however, 
that the Trustee or such Paying Agent,
before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Issuer cause to be made available to the newswire service of Bloomberg or, if Bloomberg does not operate, any similar agency a notice to the effect that such money remains
unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which will not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer. 
Section 8.07 
Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any Euros, in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by
reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer’s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes will be revived and reinstated as though
no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until such time as the Trustee or such Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be;
provided
,
 however
, that, if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer will be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes
to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

Section 9.02 
With Consent of Holders.
Except as provided in this Section 9.02, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the

existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provisions hereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained before or after a
Change of Control or in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes).

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver

hereof, the Trustee will join with the Issuer in the execution of any amended or supplemental indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein
contained, but the Trustee will not be obligated to enter into such amended or supplemental indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise. The Issuer will deliver a copy of any such amendments or
supplements to this Indenture to the Agents if the Agents are not party thereto. 
The consent of the Holders is not necessary under this
Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under this Indenture by any Holder of
Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. 
82 
Section 9.03 
Amendments to be in Supplemental Indenture.
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in an amended or supplemental indenture. 
Section 9.04 
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every
subsequent Holder or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to its Note
if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder. 
Section 9.05 
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuer in
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver. 
Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note will not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 9.06 
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
The Trustee and, insofar as their rights or duties are affected, the Agents will sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Agents, as applicable. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee will be
provided with and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) will be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 12.03 hereof, an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution
of such amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that such amendment is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Issuer and any Guarantor party thereto, enforceable against them in accordance with its
terms, subject to customary exceptions, and complies with the provisions of this Indenture. 
ARTICLE 10 
SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE 
Section 10.01 
Satisfaction and Discharge.
(a) This Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and
rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in Section 10.01(c)) as to all Notes when: 
(1) either: 
(A) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes
for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Registrar for cancellation; or 
(B) all Notes not previously delivered to the Registrar for cancellation (i) have become due and payable by reason of the
making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of notice of redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; 
83 
(2) the Issuer has deposited, or caused to be deposited with the Paying
Agent (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Paying Agent for this purpose), money in Euro or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; 
provided
 that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of this Indenture to the extent that an
amount is deposited with the Paying Agent equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, as calculated by the Issuer or on behalf of the Issuer by such Person as the Issuer shall designate, with any Applicable
Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Paying Agent on or prior to the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the
deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption. The Trustee and Paying Agent shall not be liable to any Person (including, without limitation, any Holder) for
acknowledging discharge of this Indenture in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.01, including where the amount deposited by the Issuer with the Paying Agent is insufficient for purposes of payment to Holders of the entire Indebtedness
of the Notes on the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable. The obligation to fund any deficit (as described herein) (if applicable) shall be solely the obligation of the Issuer (which the Issuer hereby acknowledges and
undertakes to fund) and not the Trustee or Paying Agent. Notwithstanding any failure of the Issuer to fund any such deficit in accordance with this Section 10.01, the Paying Agent shall apply or cause to be applied the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes on the redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, and such payment shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver of (i) any rights of the Trustee, Paying Agent or any Holder under this Indenture or
(ii) any obligation of the Issuer to fund such deficit; 
(3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under this Indenture; 
(4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Paying Agent under this
Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and 
(5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all
conditions precedent under this Article 10 relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with; 
provided
 that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to
compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this Section 10.01(a)). 
(b) If requested in writing by
the Issuer to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; 
provided, however
, that the Holders shall have received
at least five Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption
date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. 
(c) Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, if money has been deposited with the Paying Agent (or other entity
designated by the Paying Agent for this purpose) pursuant to Section 10.01, Section 10.02 and Section 8.06 will survive. In addition, nothing in this Section 10.01 will be deemed to discharge those provisions of Section 7.06
hereof, that, by their terms, survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. 
Section 10.02 
Application of Trust
Money.
Subject to Section 8.06, all money deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 10.01 shall be held in trust
and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Agent as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal, premium, if any, interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Paying Agent; but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 
84 
If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any Euro, European Government Obligations
or a combination thereof, as applicable, in accordance with Section 10.01 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, the Issuer’s and any Guarantor’s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 10.01; 
provided 
that the Issuer shall be
subrogated to the respective rights of the Trustee and Paying Agent to contest any such order or judgment and to seek remittance of such deposit to the Issuer; and 
provided 
further that if the Issuer have made any payment of principal of,
premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the Euro, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, as applicable, held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. 
ARTICLE 11 
GUARANTEES 
Section 11.01 
Guarantees.
Subject to this Article 11, each of the Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally and unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee (or Authentication Agent) and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuer hereunder or
thereunder, that: (i) the principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue
principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (to the extent permitted by law), and all other obligations of the Issuer to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder shall be promptly paid in full or
performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in
accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the “
Guaranteed Obligations
”). Failing payment when due of
any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors will be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of
collection. 
The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity
or enforceability of the Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer, any action to
enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee shall
extend to all obligations under the Notes and this Indenture (including, without limitation, interest, fees, costs and expenses) that would be owed but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to any proceeding under Bankruptcy
Law involving the Issuer or any Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against
the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenant that this Note Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete payment and performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and this Indenture and the obligations of each
Guarantor under this Note Guarantee shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment, set-off, defense, counterclaim, discharge or termination for any reason other than the complete payment and performance of the obligations contained
in the Notes and this Indenture. 
If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to any of the Issuer or the Guarantors, any amount paid either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged,
shall be reinstated in full force and effect. 
Each Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation
to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby or any collateral securing any such obligations until payment and performance in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors,
on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 hereof for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations 
85 
guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Note Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the
Holders under the Note Guarantee. 
Section 11.02 
Limitation on Liability.
Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Note
Guarantee of such Guarantor not constitute an unlawful financial assistance, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or transaction under value for purposes of any applicable law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders
and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of each Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are
relevant under such laws and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 11, result
in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law. Each Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note Guarantee shall be entitled upon payment in full
of all Note Guarantee obligations under this Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s 
pro rata
 portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the
Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. 
Section 11.03 
Additional Guarantor Limitations.
The Notes Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary who executes and delivers a supplemental indenture in the form attached hereto and
becomes a Guarantor hereunder after the Issue Date is subject to any limitations relating to such Restricted Subsidiary set out in the relevant supplemental indenture. 
Section 11.04 
Successors and Assigns.
This Article 11 shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and
assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Notes shall automatically extend to and
be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture. 
Section 11.05 
No Waiver.
Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Article 11 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly
specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 11 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. 
Section 11.06 
Modification.
No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 11, nor the consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom, shall
in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor in
any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. 
Section 11.07 
Execution of Supplemental Indenture for Future Guarantors.
(a) Each Restricted Subsidiary which will become or is required to become a Guarantor pursuant to Section 4.14 shall promptly execute and
deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form of 
Exhibit D
 to this Indenture, pursuant to which such Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under this Article 11 and shall guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by such Restricted Subsidiary 
86 
and that, subject to the application of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer and other similar laws relating to creditors’ rights generally and to the
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity, the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor is a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor, enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms and or to
such other matters as the Trustee may reasonably request. 
(b) Certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer which will guarantee or be required to
guarantee the Senior Facilities or certain other Indebtedness permitted under this Indenture shall promptly execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form of 
Exhibit D
 to this Indenture, pursuant to which such
Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under this Article 11 and shall guarantee the Guaranteed Obligations. 
Section 11.08 
No
Notation Required.
The failure to endorse a Note Guarantee on any Note shall not affect or impair the validity thereof. 
Section 11.09 
Release of Note Guarantees.
(a) The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon any of the following: 
(i) a sale, exchange, transfer or other Disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend,
distribution, dissolution or otherwise) of (x) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor (including any sale, exchange, transfer or other Disposition) following which such Guarantor is no longer a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer, or
(y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor to a Person other than the Issuer or another Subsidiary and in a manner permitted by this Indenture, in each case so long as such Guarantor is also released from its guarantee of the
Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes and any Other Debt Agreement (if applicable); 
(ii) defeasance or discharge
of the Notes, as provided in Article 8 and Article 10; 
(iii) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently)
released or discharged from its obligations, or otherwise not being a guarantor or obligor with respect to any obligations, with respect to the Senior Credit Agreement, the Convertible Notes and any Other Debt Agreement (it being understood that a
release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release); 
(iv) upon the merger, amalgamation or
consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture; 
(v) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes provided that such Note Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the
Reversion Date (as defined below); 
(vi) as described under Article 9; 
(vii) if such Guarantor was not required to create a Guarantee but did so at its option, upon the request of such Guarantor of
a release at any time (if such Guarantor would not then otherwise be required to Guarantee the Notes pursuant to this Indenture); 
(viii) upon such Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary; and 
(ix) upon payment in full of principal of, accrued and unpaid interest, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on all
of the Notes. 
(b) Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Note Guarantee, as specified in this Section 11.09, the Trustee,
upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to such release and discharge have been satisfied and that such release and discharge is authorized and
permitted under this Indenture, which the Trustee shall be entitled to rely on absolutely and without further inquiry, will take all actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, to effectuate or evidence any release of a Note Guarantee
in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected or 
87 
evidenced by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be
required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge. The Issuer may in its sole discretion elect to have any Note Guarantee remain in place as opposed to being released. 
(c) Any Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee as provided in this Section 11.09 will remain liable for the
full amount of principal of, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on, the Notes and for the other obligations of any Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article 11. 
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Issuer may elect to cause any Restricted Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to
be a Guarantor to provide a Guarantee of the Notes; provided that any subsequent release of any such Restricted Subsidiary from its obligations as a Guarantor on the basis of such Restricted Subsidiary being an Excluded Subsidiary shall be subject
to such Restricted Subsidiary having capacity to incur then-existing Liens of such Restricted Subsidiary once it is no longer a Guarantor (as determined at the time of such release).

The Issuer, any Guarantor or the Trustee, by notice to the others may designate additional
or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications. 
All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically
delivered or mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to the Depositary in
accordance with the applicable procedures of the Depositary, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of 
Book-Entry
Interests. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of the Depositary conflict with any such requirements, a notice will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Indenture if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of the
Depositary. In addition, if and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Notes will be sent to the

first-class
 mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or
any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice
or communication is given through the Depositary, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to the Depositary. 
If the Issuer
electronically delivers or mails a notice or communication to Holders, it will deliver a copy to the Trustee and each Agent at the same time. 
Section 12.02 
Communications.
(a) In no event shall the Trustee or any other entity be liable for any losses arising from the Trustee or any other entity of U.S. Bank Trust
Company, National Association receiving or transmitting any data from the Issuer or the Guarantors, any authorized Person or Officer or any party to the transaction via any non-secure method of transmission or communication, such as, but without
limitation, by facsimile or email. 
(b) The parties hereto accept that some methods of communication are not secure and none of the
Trustee or any other entity of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association shall incur liability for receiving instructions via any such non-secure method. The Trustee or any other entity of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association is
authorized to comply with and rely upon any such notice, instructions or other communications believed by it to have been sent or given by an authorized Person or Officer or an appropriate party to the transaction (or authorized representative
thereof). The Issuer or an authorized officer of the Issuer shall use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that instructions transmitted to the Trustee or any other entity of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association pursuant to this Indenture are
complete and correct. Any instructions shall be conclusively deemed to be valid instructions from the Issuer or authorized officer of the Issuer to the Trustee or any other entity of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association for the purposes of
this Indenture. 
Section 12.03 
Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent.
Upon any request or application by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee:
(a) an Officer’s Certificate (which must include the statements set forth in Section 13.04 hereof) stating that, in the opinion
of the signer, all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with; and 
(b) an
Opinion of Counsel (which must include the statements set forth in Section 13.04 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with (
provided
 that any such Opinion of Counsel may
assume matters of fact, including as a factual matter that one or more conditions precedent have occurred).

liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantors under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS INDENTURE OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY; AND EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES
AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY, AND THAT ANY PARTY TO THIS INDENTURE MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF

of this Note at 4.250% per annum. The Issuer will pay interest, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day (each, an

office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose as provided in the Indenture or, at the option of the Issuer, payment of interest and any Additional Amounts may be made by wire transfer to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the

purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the Holders will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer, and accordingly, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than
10 days’ nor more than 90 days’ prior notice, given not more than 90 days following such purchase date, to redeem any Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other

and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus any Additional Amounts, if any. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer or other offer to purchase (including a Change of Control Offer), as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer,

Redemption for Taxation Reasons
. 
(a) The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time at its discretion upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders (with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date
fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined in
Section 2.12, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of: 
(i) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, official guidance or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in Section 2.12) affecting taxation; or 
(ii) any amendment
to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, official guidance or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a
change in published administrative practice, regardless of whether such action, change or holding is with respect to the Issuer) (each of the foregoing in clauses (i) and (ii), a “
Change in Tax Law
”), 
a Payor (as defined in Section 2.12) is, or on the next Interest Payment Date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional
Amounts (or increased Additional Amounts) with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to
pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable, but not including
assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). Such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to
any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture. 
(b) Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be delivered in accordance with the procedures described in
Section 3.03. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the delivery of
any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing selected by the Issuer and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. 
(7) 
[Reserved].
(8)
Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund
. The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes. 
A-6 
(9) 
Repurchase at Option of Holder

occurs, each Holder of the Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture, to require the Issuer to repurchase (and the Issuer will be required to make a corresponding offer to purchase) all or any part of such
Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but excluding) the date of purchase as provided in, and subject to the
terms of, the Indenture. 
(10) 
Notice of Redemption
. Notice of redemption shall be given in accordance with Section 3.03 of

the Indenture. The Registrar need not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. 
(12) 
Persons Deemed Owners
. The Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes. 
(13) 
Amendment, Supplement and Waiver
. The
provisions governing amendment, supplement and waiver are set forth in Article 9 of the Indenture. 
(14) 
Defaults and Remedies
.
Events of Default and remedies are set forth in Article 6 of the Indenture.

Trustee Dealings with Issuer

individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. 
(16) 
No Recourse Against Others
. No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries (including the Issuer and the Guarantors) under the Note Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.

Representative shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made by such Borrower and shall be binding upon and enforceable against such Borrower to the same extent as if the same had been made directly by such Borrower. Each Borrower hereby
releases the Parent Borrower to the extent possible from any restrictions on representing several persons and

Restricted Subsidiary, designate such Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary as a “Subsidiary Borrower” for purposes of this Agreement. Each Subsidiary Borrower shall remain a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary so long as it remains a
Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such designation shall become effective upon the execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of (i) the aforementioned executed Borrower Designation Agreement, 
(ii) up-to-date
 certificates and Organization Documents in respect of such Subsidiary, similar to those delivered pursuant to 
Section
 4.01(b)
,
(iii) all amendments or joinders to this Agreement, any Revolving Credit Notes issued and any other Loan Document deemed reasonably necessary by the Administrative Agent to accommodate the joinder of such Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrower
hereunder and (iv) subject to the Guaranty and Security Principles, if such Subsidiary is not already a Guarantor, all Collateral Documents, guarantees, opinions and other documents and instruments as such Subsidiary shall be required to
deliver to become a Guarantor (and for the avoidance of doubt, if not already constituting Collateral, a pledge of 100% of the Capital Stock in such Subsidiary Borrower) and such other documents in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent and all documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of each such designation by a Borrower, the identity of the respective Subsidiary and the effective date of such joinder. Any Subsidiary Borrower shall continue to be a Borrower

hereunder. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (a) no Borrower Designation Agreement shall become effective as to any Subsidiary Borrower if it shall be unlawful for such Subsidiary to become a Borrower hereunder or for any Lender to make
Loans to such Subsidiary as provided herein and (b) no Borrower Termination Agreement will become effective as to any Subsidiary Borrower until all Loans made to such Subsidiary shall have been repaid and all amounts payable by such Subsidiary
in respect of interest and/or fees (and, to the extent notified by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any other amounts payable under this Agreement by such Subsidiary) shall have been paid in full; 
provided
, that such Borrower
Termination Agreement shall be effective to terminate the right of such Subsidiary to request or receive further Borrowings under this Agreement. 
(b) The Obligations of the Parent Borrower and each Subsidiary Borrower shall be joint and several in nature and subject to the provisions of
Section
 10.24

other than the United States in which any applicable Lender is not legally permitted to make Loans. In addition, the jurisdiction of organization of any 
non-U.S.
 Subsidiary requested to be a Subsidiary
Borrower shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders in light of legal permissibility and the policies and procedures of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for similarly situated companies (as
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders).

related Benchmark Replacement Date, 
Section
 3.04(b)
 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any
liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including
without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or
have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of
any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrowers. The Administrative Agent
may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion in accordance with the provisions set forth herein to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof,
in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential
damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

second
, to the
Borrowers as provided above. 
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term Benchmark Loan may be continued or converted only on the
last day of an Interest Period for such Term Benchmark Loan unless the Borrowers pay the amount due under

 3.06
 in connection therewith. During the existence of an Event of Default, at the election of the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Term Benchmark Loans having an Interest Period in excess of one (1) month. 
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the applicable Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest
Period for Term Benchmark Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The determination of the Term Benchmark by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. 
(e) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from
one Type to another, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect. 
(f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation,
if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing, which for the avoidance of doubt
does not limit such Lender’s obligations under

Section

 or the delivery of Cash Collateral in
accordance with 
Section

) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or
potential Fronting Exposure under such Tranche. 
(iii) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of
Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such

by such the L/C Issuer’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and nonappealable judgment. 
(c) 
Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto
-Renewal
 Letters of
Credit
. 
116 
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be,
upon the request of the Borrowers delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, including 
agreed-upon
 draft language for such
Letter of Credit reasonably acceptable to the applicable L/C Issuer (it being understood that such draft language for each such Letter of Credit must be in English or, if agreed to in the sole discretion of the applicable L/C issuer, accompanied by
an English translation certified by the Borrowers to be a true and correct English translation), appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrowers. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the applicable L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. at least five Business Days (or such shorter period as such L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment,
as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date
of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof and the currency in which such Letter of Credit is to be denominated; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate or other documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the
Person for whose account the requested Letter of Credit is to be issued (which must be a Borrower Party); and (H) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably request. In the case of a request for an amendment of any
outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof
(which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment and (4) such other matters as the applicable L/C Issuer may reasonably request. 
(ii) Promptly following delivery of any Letter of Credit Application to the applicable L/C Issuer, the Parent Borrower will
confirm with the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application and, if the Administrative Agent has not received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application, then the Parent Borrower will
provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless such L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance
or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in 
Article IV
 shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue
a Letter of Credit for the account of a Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (as designated in the Letter of Credit Application) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit
under any Tranche, each Revolving Credit Lender under such Tranche shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to
such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the applicable Revolving Credit Facility multiplied by the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
(iii) If a Borrower on behalf of the applicable Borrower Party so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the
applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an “
Auto
-Renewal
 Letter of Credit
”);
provided
 that any such 
Auto-Renewal
 Letter of Credit must permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each 
twelve-month
 period (commencing
with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day in each such 
twelve-month
 period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit
is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Borrowers shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such renewal. Once an 
Auto-Renewal
 Letter of Credit
has been issued, the Revolving Credit Lenders under the applicable Tranche shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C 
117 
Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; 
provided
, 
however
, that such L/C Issuer
shall not permit any such renewal if such L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of
Section
 2.03(a)(ii)
 or otherwise). 
(iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also (A) deliver to the Borrowers, the applicable Borrower Party and the Administrative Agent a true and
complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment and (B) the Administrative Agent in turn will notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the applicable Tranche of such issuance or amendment and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s
Pro Rata Share therein. 
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, the issuance of any Letters of
Credit by any L/C Issuer under this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable additional letter of credit issuance procedures and requirements as may be required by such L/C Issuer’s internal letter of credit issuance policies and
procedures, in its sole discretion, as in effect at the time of such issuance, including requirements with respect to the prior receipt by such L/C Issuer of customary “know your customer” information regarding a prospective account
party or applicant that is not a Borrower hereunder, as well as regarding any beneficiaries of a requested Letter of Credit. Additionally, if (a) the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit issued hereunder is an issuer of a letter of credit not
governed by this Agreement for the account of any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary (an “
Other L/C
”), and (b) such Letter of Credit is issued to provide credit support for such Other L/C, no amendments may be made to such
Other L/C without the consent of the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder. 
(d) 
Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations
.
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any drawing under such Letter of Credit, the applicable
L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent thereof. Each L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrowers on the date of any payment by such L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an “
Honor Date
”), and
the Borrowers shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing no later than on the next succeeding Business Day (and any reimbursement made on such next Business Day shall be taken
into account in computing interest and fees in respect of any such Letter of Credit) after the Borrowers shall have received notice of such payment with interest on the amount so paid or disbursed by such L/C Issuer, to the extent not reimbursed
prior to 11:00 a.m. in the case of drawings in Dollars or the Applicable Time in the case of drawings in any other Alternative Currency, in each case, on the next succeeding Business Day following the applicable Honor Date, from and including the
date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such L/C Issuer was reimbursed by the Borrowers therefor at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time 
plus
 the Applicable Rate as in effect from time to time for
Revolving Credit Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans. If the Borrowers fail to so reimburse such L/C Issuer on such next Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount
of the unreimbursed drawing (the “
Unreimbursed Amount
”), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, in the case of an Unreimbursed Amount, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have
requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in Dollars or the other applicable Alternative Currency, as applicable, to be disbursed on such date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, in accordance with the requirements of
Section
 2.02
 but without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in 
Section
 2.02
 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, Term 
118 
Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as the case may be, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments under the applicable Tranche and the conditions set forth
in 
Section
 4.0
2
 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this 
Section
 2.03(d)(
i
)
 may be
given by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing; 
provided
 that the lack of such a prompt confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
(ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender (including each Lender acting as an L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section
 2.03(d)(
i
)
 make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer, at the Administrative Agent’s
Office in an amount equal to its applicable Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section
 2.03(d)(iii)
, each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Credit Loan under the applicable Tranche to the Borrowers in such amount. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit the funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer. 
(iii) With respect to any
Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in 
Section
 4.0
2
 cannot be satisfied (other than the condition in
Section
 4.02(C)
, which shall be deemed to be satisfied) or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that
is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate then applicable to Base Rate Revolving Credit Loans. In such event, each Revolving Credit
Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to 
Section
 2.03(d)(ii)
 shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall
constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this 
Section
 2.03
. 
(iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender under the applicable Tranche funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to
this 
Section
 2.03(d)
 to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s applicable Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the
account of such L/C Issuer. 
(v) Each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C
Advances to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this 
Section
 2.03(d)
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C Issuer, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or
(C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; 
provided
, 
however
, that each Revolving Credit Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this
Section
 2.03(d)
 is subject to the conditions set forth in 
Section
 4.0
2
 (other than delivery by the Borrowers of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrowers to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the applicable L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
119 
(vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this 
Section
 2.03(d)
 by the time specified in
Section
 2.03(d)(ii)
, then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with
interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect and a
rate reasonably determined by such L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the
foregoing. If such Lender pays such principal amount, the amount so paid (less interest and fees) shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may
be. A certificate of the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this 
Section
 2.03(d)(vi)
 shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. 
(e) 
Repayment of Participations
. (i) If, at any time after an L/C Issuer under any Tranche has made a payment under
any Letter of Credit issued by it and has received from any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with 
Section
 2.03(d)
, the Administrative Agent receives for the
account of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrowers or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the
Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its applicable Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the
same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an
L/C Issuer pursuant to 
Section
 2.03(d)(
i
)
 is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in 
Section
 10.06
 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by
such L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender under the applicable Tranche shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its applicable Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment
in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
(f) 
Obligations Absolute
. The obligation of the Borrowers to
reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute and unconditional, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances,
including the following: 
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other
agreement or instrument relating thereto; 
(ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right
that the Borrowers or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the applicable L/C Issuer or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
120 
(iv) any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft, certificate or other drawing document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the applicable L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
trustee in bankruptcy, 
debtor-in-possession,
 assignee for the benefit of creditors, administrator, administrative receiver, judicial manager, liquidator, receiver or
other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
(v) any exchange, release or 
non-perfection
 of any Collateral, or any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrowers in respect of such Letter of Credit; or 
(vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other
circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against the obligations of the Borrowers or any Subsidiaries hereunder. 
The Borrowers shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to them and, in the event of
any claim of noncompliance with the instructions of the Borrowers or other irregularity, the Borrowers will promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer. The Borrowers shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against any L/C Issuer
and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
(g) 
Role of L/C Issuer
. Each Lender and the Borrowers agree that,
in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and other documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the applicable L/C Issuer, any 
Agent-Related
 Person
nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the applicable L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving
Credit Lenders or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
nonappealable judgment or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; 
provided
, 
however
, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrowers from pursuing such rights and remedies as
they may have against the beneficiary or transferee at Law or under any other agreement. None of the applicable L/C Issuer, any 
Agent-Related
 Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or
assignees of such L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in 
clauses (
i
)
 through 
(vi)
 of 
Section
 2.03(f)
; 
provided
, 
however
, that anything
in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrowers may have a claim against such L/C Issuer, and such L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrowers, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to indirect, special,
punitive, consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrowers which a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final 
non-appealable
 judgment were caused by such L/C Issuer’s bad faith,
willful misconduct or gross negligence. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (x) the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, (1) accept documents that appear on their face to be in order and make payment upon
such documents, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and (2) decline to accept documents and make payments if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms and
conditions of such Letter of Credit, and (y) such L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits
thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. 
121 
(h) 
Letter of Credit Fees
. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its applicable Pro Rata Share, a Letter of Credit fee which shall accrue for each Letter of Credit of each Tranche in an amount equal to the Applicable Rate then in effect for Term
Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility multiplied by the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
Letter of Credit if such maximum amount increases automatically pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit); 
provided
, 
however
, that any Letter of Credit fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to
any Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to this 
Section
 2.03
 shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, to the other Revolving Credit Lenders under the applicable Tranche in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective applicable Pro Rata Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section
 2.17(a)(iv)
, with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account. Such Letter of Credit fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and shall be due and payable
on the fifteenth day after the end of each fiscal quarter, in respect of the quarterly period then ending (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of
Credit, and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. 
(i)

Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
. If the Maturity Date
in respect of any Tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other Tranches of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the Maturity Date shall not have

 2.03
) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such
non-terminating
 Tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face
amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and to the extent any Letters of Credit are not able to be reallocated pursuant to this 
clause (l)

provided
 that (1) such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m. (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of any Term Benchmark Loans, (B) five Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of any RFR Loans or (C) one Business Day

(y) a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (3) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be (x) in a principal amount of $1,000,000, or (y) a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less,
the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment, the Tranche of Loans to be prepaid, the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Term Benchmark Loans are to be prepaid, the
Interest Period(s) of such Loans (except that if the class of Loans to be prepaid includes both Base Rate Loans and Term Benchmark Loans, absent direction by the Borrowers, the applicable prepayment shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans to the
full extent thereof before application to Term Benchmark Loans, in each case in a manner that minimizes the amount payable by the Borrowers in respect of such prepayment pursuant to 
Section
 3.06
). The Administrative Agent
will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender’s ratable share of the relevant Facility). If such notice is given by the
Borrowers, subject to 
clause (ii)

Section
 2.17
 and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each prepayment of outstanding Term Loan Tranches pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(a)
 shall be applied to the applicable Term Loan Tranche or Term Loan Tranches as
designated by the Borrowers in such notice on a 
pro
rata

 and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
each prepayment of an outstanding Term Loan Tranche pursuant to this 
Section

 shall be applied to the remaining amortization payments of the applicable Term Loan Tranche (x) in the case of any Term Loan B
Tranche, as directed by the Borrowers (or, if the Borrowers have not made such direction, in direct order of maturity), and (y) in the case of any Term Loan A Tranche, on a pro rata basis to the remaining amortization payments under such Term
Loan A Tranche, but in any event on a 
pro
rata
 basis to the Lenders within such applicable Term Loan Tranche. 
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any notice of prepayment under
Section
 2.05(a)(
i

Effective Date, the applicable Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of the applicable Term Lenders (x) with respect to 
clauses (A)
 and 
(B)
, a prepayment premium in an amount equal to 1.00%
of the principal amount of such

(i) For any Excess Cash Flow Period, within ten Business Days after financial statements have been delivered pursuant to
Section
 6.01(a)
 and the related Compliance Certificate has been delivered pursuant to 
Section
 6.02(b)
 (or, if later, the date on which such financial statements and such Compliance Certificate are
required to be delivered), the applicable Borrowers shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to (A) 50% (as may be adjusted pursuant to the proviso below) of Excess Cash Flow for such Excess Cash Flow Period,
minus
 (B) the sum of (without double counting and only to the extent the Parent Borrower has not elected to reflect such deduction in the calculation of Excess Cash Flow): 
(1) 
voluntary prepayments
: (A) the aggregate amount of voluntary principal prepayments of the Loans or
Indebtedness that is 
pari passu
 in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans, in each case, made during the period commencing on the first day of the relevant Excess Cash Flow Period and ending on the date immediately prior to
the date on which the relevant Excess Cash Flow prepayment is or would be required to be made (including prepayments at a discount to par and open market purchases, with credit given for the principal amount of the Loans so retired or purchased,
124 
and prepayments in connection with lender replacement provisions (including pursuant to 
Section
 3.08
)) (except prepayments of Loans under any Revolving Tranche or other
revolving Indebtedness that is 
pari passu
 in right of payment and security with the Revolving Credit Commitments that are not accompanied by a corresponding permanent commitment reduction of the Revolving Tranches), in each case other than to
the extent that any such prepayment is funded with the proceeds of Specified Refinancing Debt, Refinancing Notes or any other 
long-term
 Indebtedness (“
Voluntary Debt Reductions
”), 
plus
(B) any amounts in respect of a Voluntary Debt Reduction carried forward from any prior fiscal year in accordance with 
clause (c)
 of the proviso below; 
provided
 that: 
(a)
such percentage in respect of any Excess Cash Flow Period shall be reduced to (x) 25% if the Consolidated First
Lien Net Leverage Ratio, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as of the last day of the fiscal year to which such Excess Cash Flow Period relates was equal to or less than 3.00:1.00 but greater than 2.50:1.00 and (y) 0% if the Consolidated First Lien Net
Leverage Ratio, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis as of the last day of the fiscal year to which such Excess Cash Flow Period relates was equal to or less than 2.50:1.00 (the amount required to be repaid pursuant to this
Section
 2.05(b)(i)
, after giving effect to this 
clause (a)
, the “
ECF Prepayment Amount
”); 
(b)
no prepayment shall be required with respect to any Excess Cash Flow Period unless the ECF Prepayment Amount
exceeds the greater of $202,500,000 and 15% of the EBITDA Grower Amount (the “
ECF De Minimis Amount
”), and in such case, the ECF Prepayment Amount shall be the amount in excess thereof; 
provided
, 
further
, that, if
the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to any Excess Cash Flow prepayment would result in the percentage in respect of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period being reduced to 0%, then no prepayment
shall be required; 
(c)
notwithstanding the terms of 
Section
 2.05(b)(
i
)
 above, to the extent
the aggregate amount of Voluntary Debt Reductions during any relevant fiscal year exceeds the amount of any Excess Cash Flow prepayment that would have otherwise been required (after deducting the ECF De Minimis Amount), the amount of such excess
shall be carried forward to the subsequent fiscal year and deducted (on a 
dollar-for-dollar
 basis) from any Excess Cash Flow prepayment required in any such subsequent
fiscal year (after calculating the applicable Excess Cash Flow percentage for the relevant fiscal year); and 
(d)
solely with respect to the Excess Cash Flow Period ending December 31, 2022, Excess Cash Flow shall equal
(A) the annual Excess Cash Flow in respect of such Excess Cash Flow Period multiplied by (B) the fraction obtained by dividing (1) the number of calendar days from the Closing Date to December 31, 2022 by (2) 360.
For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable Borrowers may use a portion of Excess Cash Flow to prepay or repurchase any other
Indebtedness that is 
pari passu
 in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans to the extent such other Indebtedness and the Liens securing the same are permitted hereunder and the documentation governing such other Indebtedness
requires such a prepayment or repurchase thereof with such Excess Cash Flow, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (1) the amount of such Excess Cash Flow and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding
principal amount of such other Indebtedness (or to the extent such amount is not in Dollars, such equivalent amount of such Indebtedness converted into Dollars as determined in accordance with 
Section
 1.08
) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and such other Indebtedness (or to the extent such amount is not in Dollars, such equivalent amount of such Indebtedness converted into Dollars as determined in
accordance with 
Section
 1.08
)). 
125 
(ii) If any Asset Sale made pursuant to
Section
 7.04(a)
 or Casualty Event (or series of related Asset Sales pursuant to 
Section
 7.04(a)
 or Casualty Events) results in the receipt by the Parent Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of
aggregate Net Cash Proceeds in excess of the greater of $202,500,000 and 15% of the EBITDA Grower Amount (a “
Relevant Transaction
”), then, except to the extent the applicable Borrowers elect to reinvest all or a portion of such
Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with 
Section
 7.04
, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay, subject to 
Section
 2.05(b)(viii)
 and 
(ix)
, an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount
equal to 100% (as may be adjusted pursuant to the proviso below) of the Net Cash Proceeds received from such Relevant Transaction within 15 Business Days of receipt thereof (or within 15 Business Days (1) after the later of the date the
threshold referred to above is first exceeded and the date the relevant Net Cash Proceeds are received or (2) after the Parent Borrower elects not to pursue the reinvestment (or an alternative reinvestment) within the period set forth in
Section
 7.04
) by the Parent Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary; 
provided
 that: 
(A)
the applicable Borrowers may use a portion of the Net Cash Proceeds received from such Relevant Transaction to prepay or repurchase any other Indebtedness that is 
pari passu
 in right of payment and security with the Initial Term Loans to the
extent such other Indebtedness and the Liens securing the same are permitted hereunder and the documentation governing such other Indebtedness requires such a prepayment or repurchase thereof with the proceeds of such Relevant Transaction, to the
extent not deducted in the calculation of Net Cash Proceeds, in each case in an amount not to exceed the product of (1) the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of
such other Indebtedness (or to the extent such amount is not in Dollars, such equivalent amount of such Indebtedness converted into Dollars as determined in accordance with 
Section
 1.08
) and the denominator of which is the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Term Loans and such other Indebtedness (or to the extent such amount is not in Dollars, such equivalent amount of such Indebtedness converted into Dollars as determined in accordance with
Section
 1.08
); 
(B) such prepayment percentage shall be reduced from 100% to 0% if, on a Pro
Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale or Casualty Event, as the case may be, and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be equal to or less than 2.50:1.00; 
provided
, that if the
Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to any prepayment that would otherwise be required pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(b)(ii)
 would result in the prepayment percentage being
reduced to 0%, then such reduced prepayment percentage shall apply after giving effect to the required prepayment amount to achieve such reduced prepayment percentage; 
(C) only the amount of Net Cash Proceeds in excess of the greater of $202,500,000 and 15% of the EBITDA Grower Amount for any
Asset Sale or Casualty Event (or series of related Asset Sales or Casualty Events) shall be subject to prepayment pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(b)(ii)
 and, in such case, the required prepayment shall be only the amount in
excess thereof. 
(iii) Upon the incurrence or issuance by the Parent Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any
Refinancing Notes, any Specified Refinancing Term Loans or any Indebtedness not expressly permitted to be incurred or issued pursuant to 
Section
 7.01
, the applicable Borrowers shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of
Term Loan Tranches in an amount equal to 100% of all Net Cash Proceeds received therefrom immediately upon receipt thereof by the Parent Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary. 
126 
(iv) [Reserved]. 
(v) If for any reason the sum of the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings or the sum of outstanding Specified Refinancing
Revolving Loans at any time exceed the sum of the applicable Revolving Tranche in respect thereof (including after giving effect to any reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to 
Section
 2.06
)
, the
Borrowers shall immediately prepay the applicable Revolving Tranche and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations related thereto in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; 
provided
, 
however
, that the Borrowers shall not be required
to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(b)(v)
 unless after the prepayment in full of the applicable Revolving Tranche the sum of the Total Revolving Credit Outstandings or the outstanding
Specified Refinancing Revolving Loans, as the case may be, exceed the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments or the commitments to make Specified Refinancing Revolving Loans, as the case may be, then in effect. 
(vi) Subject to 
Section
 2.17
, each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to this
Section
 2.05(b
)
 shall be applied to then-outstanding Term Loan A Tranches and Term Loan B Tranches on a 
pro
rata
 basis, and within the applicable Term Loan Tranche or Term Loan Tranches, in the case of
Term Loan A Tranches, on a 
pro
rata
 basis among such Term Loan A Tranches, and in the case of Term Loan B Tranches, as directed by the applicable Borrowers making such prepayment, in each case on a 
pro
rata
 basis to the
Lenders within such Tranche (other than a prepayment of (x) Revolving Credit Loans set forth in 
Section
 2.05(b)(v)
, which shall be applied on a 
pro
rata
 basis to the Lenders within the applicable
Revolving Tranches, (y) Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans, as applicable, with the proceeds of Indebtedness incurred pursuant to 
Section
 2.18

applicable, being refinanced pursuant thereto or (z) Term Loans with the proceeds of any Refinancing Notes issued to the extent permitted under 
clause (a)
 of the definition of “Permitted Debt”, which shall be applied to
the Term Loan Tranche being refinanced pursuant thereto). Amounts to be applied to a Term Loan Tranche in connection with prepayments made pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(b)
 shall be applied to the remaining amortization
payments of the applicable Term Loan Tranche or Term Loan Tranches (x) in the case of any Term Loan B Tranche, as directed by the Borrowers (or, if the Borrowers have not made such direction, in direct order of maturity) and (y) in the
case of any Term Loan A Tranche, on a pro rata basis to the remaining amortization payments under such Term Loan A Tranche, but in any event on a 
pro
rata
 basis to the Lenders within such applicable Term Loan Tranche. Each prepayment
of Term Loans under a Facility pursuant to this 
Section
 2.05(b)
 shall be applied on a 
pro
rata
 basis to the then outstanding Base Rate Loans, Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans under such Facility;
provided
 that, if there are no Declining Lenders with respect to such prepayment, then the amount thereof shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans 
pro
rata
 under such Facility to the full extent thereof before application to
Term Benchmark Loans, in each case in a manner that minimizes the amount payable by the applicable Borrowers in respect of such prepayment pursuant to 
Section
 3.06
. 
(vii) All prepayments under this 
Section
 2.05
 shall be made together with, in the case of any such
prepayment of a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period therefor, any amounts owing in respect of such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan pursuant to 
Section
 3.06

extent applicable, any additional amounts required pursuant to 
Section
 2.05(a)(iii)

of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans is required to be made under this 
Section
 2.05(b)
, other than on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, the applicable
Borrowers may, in their sole discretion, deposit the amount of any such prepayment otherwise required to be made thereunder into a Cash Collateral account until the last day of such Interest Period, at which time the Administrative Agent shall be
authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrowers or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of such Loans in accordance with this 
Section
 2.05(b)
 (it being agreed, for
clarity, that interest shall continue to accrue on the Loans so prepaid until the amount so deposited is actually applied to prepay such Loans). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall
also be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrowers or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of the outstanding Loans in accordance with this 
Section
 2.05(b)

regulation (including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions, restrictions on upstreaming of cash intra-group and fiduciary and statutory duties of any direct or officers of such Subsidiaries) from being repatriated to the
applicable Borrowers or so prepaid or such repatriation or prepayment would present a material risk of liability for the applicable Subsidiary or its directors or officers (or gives rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties
by any director or officer), an amount equal to the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow so affected will not be required to be applied to repay Term Loans at the times provided in this

the Borrowers elect for this 
clause (c)
 to be applicable to a given prepayment, other than in connection with any Refinancing Notes or any Specified Refinancing Term Loans), may elect not to accept such prepayment as provided below. The
Borrowers may notify the Administrative Agent of any event giving rise to a prepayment under 
Section

i
)
 or 
(b)(ii)

such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment that is required to be made under 
Section
 2.05(b)(
i
)
 or 
(b)(ii)

“
Prepayment Amount

of any such prepayment (any such Lender, a “
Declining Lender
”) by providing written notice to the Administrative Agent no later than four Business Days after the date of such Appropriate Lender’s receipt of notice from the
Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment. If any Appropriate Lender does not give a notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such fourth Business Day informing the Administrative Agent that it declines to accept the applicable
prepayment, then such Lender will be deemed to have accepted such prepayment. On any Prepayment Date, an amount equal to the Prepayment Amount minus the portion thereof allocable to Declining Lenders, in each case for such Prepayment Date, shall be
paid to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers and applied by the Administrative Agent to prepay Term Loans under the Term Loan Tranches owing to Appropriate Lenders (other than Declining Lenders) as directed by the applicable Borrowers in the

Term Loan Tranche, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or the unused Revolving Credit Commitments under any Revolving Tranche; 
provided
 that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent three Business Days (or such

129 
Revolving Credit Commitments under such Tranche and (B) the Letter of Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized
hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Any such notice of termination or reduction of commitments pursuant to this 
Section
 2.06(a)
 may state that it is conditioned upon the occurrence or 
non-occurrence
 of any event specified therein (including the effectiveness of other credit facilities), in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrowers (by written notice to the Administrative Agent on or
prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations in cash and in immediately available funds (other than
(A) contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been asserted and (B) obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements) and the expiration without any pending drawing or
termination of all Letters of Credit (other than Letters of Credit which have been, in each case, Cash Collateralized or as to which arrangements satisfactory to the L/C Issuer that issued such Letters of Credit shall have been made), this Agreement
shall automatically terminate and the Administrative Agent shall comply with 
Section

(i) Upon the incurrence by the Parent Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary of any
Specified Refinancing Debt constituting revolving credit facilities, the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders under the Tranche of Revolving Credit Loans being refinanced shall be automatically and permanently reduced on a ratable basis by an
amount equal to 100% of the Commitments under such revolving credit facilities. 
(ii) If after giving effect to any
reduction or termination of Revolving Credit Commitments under this 
Section
 2.06
, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit shall be
automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. 
(iii) The aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments with respect to any
Tranche of the Revolving Credit Facility shall automatically and permanently be reduced to zero on the Maturity Date with respect to such Tranche of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
(c)

applicable Facility of any termination or reduction of the Commitments under any Term Loan Tranche, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Revolving Credit Commitment under this 
Section

under a Facility or a Tranche thereof, the Commitment of each Lender under such Facility or Tranche thereof shall be reduced by such Lender’s ratable share of the amount by which such Facility or Tranche thereof is reduced (other than the
termination of the Commitment of any Lender as provided in 
Section
 3.08
). All commitment fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments and unpaid, shall be paid on the effective date
of such termination.

of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share of each Tranche of the Revolving Credit Facility, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee multiplied by the actual daily amount by which the aggregate
Revolving Credit Commitments under such Tranche exceed the sum of (A) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans under such Tranche and (B) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations under such Tranche, subject to adjustment as

Section 2.10 
Computation of Interest and
Fees

Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or Daily Simple RFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(b) [Reserved]. 
Section 2.11 
Evidence of Indebtedness
. 
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and evidenced by
one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent, acting solely for purposes of Treasury Regulations 
Section 5f.103-1(c),
 as a
non-fiduciary
 agent for the applicable Borrowers, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be prima facie evidence
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the applicable Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit the obligation of the
applicable Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the written request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrowers shall promptly execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the
date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 
(b) In addition to the accounts and
records referred to in 
Section
 2.11(a)
, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entries in the
Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
133 
(c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to
Sections 2.11(a)
 and 
(b)
, and by each Lender in its accounts or records pursuant to 
Sections 2.11(a)
 and 
(b)
, shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and
payable from the applicable Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such accounts or records, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; 
provided
 that the failure
of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such accounts or records shall not limit the obligations of the applicable Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. 
Section 2.12 
Payments Generally; Administrative Agent
’
s 
Clawback
. 
(a) 
General
. All payments to be made by the applicable Borrowers shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to payments in an Alternative Currency (other than Dollars or Euros), all payments by the applicable Borrowers hereunder shall be made to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars or Euros, as applicable, and in each case in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m.
(New York City time) on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder in an Alternative Currency (other than Dollars or Euros) shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the
dates specified herein. If, for any reason, the Borrowers are prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency (other than Dollars), the Borrowers shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of
such Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share in respect of the relevant Facility or Tranche thereof (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in
like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) in the case of payments in Dollars or Euros, or after the Applicable Time specified
by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in any other Alternative Currency, shall, in each case, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made
by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; 
provided
,
however
, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, as applicable, to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
Business Day. An L/C Issuer can elect to receive payments in respect of Letters of Credit in Dollars rather than in an Alternative Currency. 
(b) (i) 
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with and at the time required by
Section
 2.02(b)
 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrowers a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Lender does not in fact make its share of the applicable
134 
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then such Lender and the Borrowers severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand an amount equal to such applicable share
in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans under the
applicable Facility. If both the Borrowers and such Lender pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrowers the amount of such interest paid by the
Borrowers for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid (less interest and fees) shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by
the Borrowers shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrowers may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make its share of any Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent. 
(ii) 
Payments by the Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or an L/C Issuer hereunder that the applicable Borrowers will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the applicable Borrowers have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In
such event, if the applicable Borrowers do not in fact make such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed by the Administrative Agent to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any reasonable administrative, processing or similar
fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing. 
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender
or the Borrowers with respect to any amount owing under this 
Section
 2.12(b)
 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
(c) 
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by
such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this 
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrowers by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article IV
 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender on demand, without interest. 
(d) 
Obligations of the Lenders Several
. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of
Credit and to make payments pursuant to 
Section
 9.07
 are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section
 9.07
 on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Loan or, to fund its participation or to make its payment under 
Section
 9.07
. 
135 
(e) 
Funding Source
. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
(f) 
Insufficient Funds
. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all
amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
 first
, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
 second
, toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C
Borrowings then due to such parties. 
(g) 
Unallocated Funds
. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the
Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to,
elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender’s ratable share of the sum of (a) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (b) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations
outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender. 
Section 2.13 
Sharing of Payments
. If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein (including the application of funds
arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such
participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations held by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such
Loans or such participations, as the case may be, 
pro
rata
 with each of them; 
provided
, 
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the
circumstances described in 
Section
 10.06
 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to
the purchasing Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the
total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrowers agree that any Lender so
purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to 
Section
 10.09
) with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of each Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased
under this 
Section
 2.13
 and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this 
Section
 2.13
 shall from and
after such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the
original owner of the Obligations purchased. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in 
Section
 2.16
, (B) the
assignments and participations (including by means of a Dutch Auction and open market debt repurchases) described in 
Section
 10.07
, (C) (i) the incurrence of any New Term Loans in accordance with
Section
 2.14
, (ii) the prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans in accordance with 
Section
 2.14(e)
 in connection with a Revolving Credit Commitment Increase or (iii) any Specified Refinancing Debt
in accordance with 
Section
 2.18
, (D) any loan modification offer described in 
Section
 10.01
, (E) any Extension described in 
Section
 2.22
 or (F) any applicable
circumstances contemplated by 
Sections
 2.05(b)
, 
2.14

2.16
,

 or

The Borrowers may designate any Incremental Arranger of any New Loan Commitments with such
titles under the New Loan Commitments as the Borrowers may deem appropriate. 
(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrowers will not be
obligated to approach any Lender to participate in any New Loan Commitments. Any Lender approached to participate in any New Loan Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to participate in such increase or new facility. The
Borrowers may also invite additional Eligible Assignees reasonably satisfactory to the Incremental Arranger and, solely in connection with a Revolving Credit Commitment Increase or New Revolving Facility, with the consent of the Administrative Agent
and each L/C Issuer (to the extent the consent of any of the foregoing would be required to assign Revolving Credit Loans to such Eligible Assignee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) to become Lenders pursuant

(c) If (i) a Revolving Tranche or a Term Loan Tranche is increased in accordance with this
Section

effective date (the “
Increase Effective Date
”) and the final allocation of such increase, New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility among the applicable Lenders. The Incremental Arranger shall promptly notify the applicable
Lenders of the final allocation of such increase, New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility and the Increase Effective Date. In connection with (i) any increase in a Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Tranche or (ii) any addition of a New
Term Facility or New Revolving Facility, in each case, pursuant to this 
Section
 2.14
, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended in writing (which may be executed and delivered by the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the Incremental Arranger (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and any such Incremental Arranger to execute and deliver any such documentation)) in order to establish the New Term Facility or New
Revolving Facility or to effectuate the increases to the Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Tranche and to reflect any technical changes necessary or appropriate to give effect to such increase or new facility in accordance with its terms as set forth
herein pursuant to the documentation relating to such New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility. As of the Increase Effective Date, in the case of an increase to an existing Term Loan Tranche, the amortization schedule for the Term Loan Tranche
then increased set forth in 
Section
 2.07(a)
 (or any other applicable amortization schedule for New Term Loans or Specified Refinancing Term Loans) shall be amended in writing (which may be executed and delivered by the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Incremental Arranger (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and any such Incremental Arranger to execute and deliver any such documentation)) to increase the 
then-remaining
 unpaid installments of principal by an aggregate amount equal to the additional Loans under such Term Loan Tranche being made on such date, such aggregate amount to be applied to increase such
installments ratably in accordance with the amounts in effect immediately prior to the Increase Effective Date.

Revolving Credit Commitment Increase, Term Commitment Increase or addition of New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility pursuant to this 
Section

, (i) subject to 
Section
 1.02(
i
)
with respect to timing of such determination, no Event of Default under 
Section
 8.01(a)
, or (in each case, solely with respect to the Borrowers) 
clauses (f)
 or 
(g)
 of
Section
 8.01
 would exist immediately after giving effect to such increase or, in the case of a transaction governed by Section 1.02(i), no Event of Default exists as of the Transaction Commitment Date; (ii) (A) in
the case of any New Revolving Facility, (1) the final maturity shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility, and (2) no amortization or mandatory commitment reduction prior to the Maturity Date
applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility shall be required, and (B) in the case of any New Term Facility, other than in the case of Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt and amounts not in excess
139 
of the Inside Maturity Basket at the time of Incurrence, such New Term Facility shall have a final maturity no earlier than the then Latest Maturity Date of any then-outstanding Initial Term B
Loans and the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such New Term Facility shall be no shorter than that of any then-outstanding Initial Term B Loans; (iii) except with respect to the 
All-in
 Yield and as
set forth in 
subclause (B)
 above with respect to final maturity and Weighted Average Life to Maturity, any such New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility shall have terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent; and
(iv) to the extent reasonably requested by the Incremental Arranger and expressly set forth in the documentation relating to such New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility, the Administrative Agent shall have received legal opinions,
resolutions, officers’ certificates, reaffirmation agreements and/or subsequent ranking agreements or amendment agreements to, confirmations of and/or lower ranking Collateral Documents, as applicable, consistent with those delivered on the
Closing Date under 
Section
 4.01
 or delivered from time to time pursuant to 
Section
 6.12
 and/or 
Section
 6.16
 with respect to the Borrowers and each material Subsidiary
Guarantor that is organized in a jurisdiction for which counsel to the Administrative Agent advises that such deliveries are reasonably necessary to preserve the Collateral in such jurisdiction (other than changes to such legal opinions resulting
from a change in Law, change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion). Subject to the foregoing, the conditions precedent to each such increase or New Loan Commitment shall be solely those agreed to by the Lenders providing such
increase or New Loan Commitment, as applicable, and the Borrowers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the terms of any New Revolving Facility shall be substantially identical to the Revolving Credit Facility, except for (i) payments of
interest and fees at different rates, (ii) terms that are applicable only after the then Latest Maturity Date of the Revolving Credit Facility or (iii) such terms as may be included subject solely as to administrative matters and subject
to the Administrative Agent’s consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and (y) the terms of any New Term Facility or New Revolving Facility may be (but are not required to be) incorporated if
otherwise reasonably satisfactory to Parent Borrower, the Incremental Arranger and the Administrative Agent. To the extent the Borrowers establish a New Revolving Facility, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall amend this Agreement,
if applicable, to require borrowings and repayments on a 
pro
rata
 basis among Revolving Tranches (except for (A) payments of interest and fees at different rates on the Revolving Credit Commitments (and related outstandings),
(B) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of any Revolving Credit Loan and (C) repayments made in connection with a permanent repayment and termination of the Revolving Credit Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments of Revolving Credit
Loans after the effective date of such New Revolving Facility). 
(e) On the Increase Effective Date with respect to an increase to an
existing Revolving Tranche, (x) each Revolving Credit Lender immediately prior to such increase will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assigned to each Lender providing a portion of the increase to the Revolving Credit
Commitments (each, a “
Revolving Commitment Increase Lender
”), and each such Revolving Commitment Increase Lender will automatically and without further act be deemed to have assumed, a portion of such Revolving Credit
Lender’s participations hereunder in outstanding L/C Obligations such that, after giving effect to each such deemed assignment and assumption of participations, the percentage of the aggregate outstanding participations hereunder in L/C
Obligations will equal the Pro Rata Share of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all Revolving Credit Lenders represented by such Revolving Credit Lender’s Revolving Credit Commitment and (y) if, on the date of such increase,
there are any Revolving Credit Loans outstanding, such Revolving Credit Loans shall on or prior to the Increase Effective Date be prepaid from the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans made hereunder (reflecting such increase in Revolving Credit
Commitments), which prepayment shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the Revolving Credit Loans being prepaid and any costs incurred by any Lender in accordance with 
Section
 3.06
. The Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing, 
pro
rata
 borrowing and 
pro
rata
 payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence. The additional Term Loans made under the Term Loan Tranche subject to the increases shall be made by the applicable Lenders 
140 
participating therein pursuant to the procedures set forth in 
Sections
 2.01
 and 
2.02
 and on the date of the making of such new Term Loans, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in 
Sections 2.01
 and 
2.02
, such new Loans shall be added to (and form part of) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans under such Term Loan Tranche on a 
pro
rata
 basis (based on the
relative sizes of the various outstanding Borrowings), so that each Lender under such Term Loan Tranche will participate proportionately in each then outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans under the Term Loan Tranche. 
(f) (i) Each New Revolving Facility and New Term Facility shall rank 
pari passu
 in right of payment with the other Facilities, not
be Guaranteed by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor under each of the other Facilities (
provided
 that, for the avoidance of doubt, any New Revolving Facility and New Term Facility need not be Guaranteed
by all Loan Parties under the other Facilities) and shall be either unsecured or secured by the Collateral (and, to the extent secured by the Collateral, secured either on a first lien “equal and ratable” basis with the other Facilities
or on a “junior” basis with the other Facilities, in each case over the same (or less) Collateral that secures the Facilities (and in each case, such New Revolving Facility or New Term Facility shall be subject to the Applicable
Intercreditor Arrangements)); and (ii) any New Term Facility shall share ratably (or on a lesser basis) with respect to any mandatory prepayments of the Term Facilities (other than mandatory prepayments resulting from a refinancing of any
Facility, which may be applied exclusively to the applicable Term Loan Tranche or Revolving Tranche being refinanced). 
(g) If the
Incremental Arranger is not the Administrative Agent, the actions authorized to be taken by the Incremental Arranger herein shall be done in consultation with the Administrative Agent and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this 
Section
 2.14
 (including amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents), any comments to such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent shall be reflected therein. 
(h) To the extent any New Revolving Facility or New Term Facility shall be denominated in an
Alternative Currency other than Dollars, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended to the extent necessary or appropriate to provide for the administrative and operational provisions applicable to such Alternative Currency, in
each case as are reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(i) To the extent any Guarantee or security granted prior to the
date of incurrence under this 
Section
 2.14
 to support the Obligations in any jurisdiction requires application, registration or similar steps to be taken in such jurisdiction for any New Revolving Facility, Revolving Credit
Commitment Increase, New Term Facility, and/or Term Commitment Increase which the applicable Borrower and the lenders under such facility desire to benefit on a 
pari passu
 basis from such Guarantees and/or such security are not obtained prior
to such incurrence, such inability to complete such application, registration, filing or equivalent perfection requirements shall not be deemed to adversely impact the 
pari passu
 nature of such applicable facility hereunder and the relevant
provisions of this Agreement (including 
Section
 2.03
 and 
8.04
) shall be interpreted as if such applicable facility benefits from such Guarantee or security. 
Section 2.15 
Incremental 
Equivalent Debt
. 
(a) The Borrowers or any Guarantor may from time to time after the Closing Date issue one or more series of senior secured, senior unsecured,
senior subordinated, subordinated notes, loans or Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt (which notes, loans and/or Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt, shall be either unsecured or secured by the Collateral (and, to the extent secured by the
Collateral, secured either on a first lien “equal and ratable” basis with the other Facilities or on a “junior” basis with the other Facilities, in each case over the same (or less) Collateral that secures the Facilities (and
in each case, shall 
141 
be subject to the Applicable Intercreditor Arrangements))) and shall not be guaranteed by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Borrower or Subsidiary Guarantor under the Facilities (such
notes, loans and/or Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt, collectively, “
Incremental Equivalent Debt

with respect to the Borrowers) 
clauses (f)

Debt shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of (x) $1,000,000 (or the equivalent Dollar Amount) and (y) the entire amount that may be requested under this 
Section
 2.15
; 
provided
, 
further
, that any New
Loan Commitments established pursuant to 
Section
 2.14
 and Incremental Equivalent Debt issued pursuant to this 
Section
 2.15
, (A) at the Borrower Representative’s option, will count, first, to
reduce the amount available under the 
Ratio-Based
 Incremental Facilities (to the extent compliant therewith), second, to reduce the amount available under the
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facilities and, third, to reduce the maximum amount under the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facilities, (B) Incremental Equivalent Debt
pursuant to this 
Section
 2.15
 may be incurred under the 
Ratio-Based
 Incremental Facilities, the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facilities and the 
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facilities, and proceeds from any such incurrence may be utilized in a single transaction or series of related transactions, at the Parent Borrower’s option, by first calculating
the incurrence under the 
Ratio-Based
 Incremental Facilities (without inclusion of any amounts substantially concurrently utilized pursuant to the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental
Facility or the 
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility or any amounts substantially concurrently incurred under 
Section
 7.01
 (other than any Ratio Debt
or Acquisition Ratio Debt incurred pursuant to 
Section
 7.01
)) and then calculating the incurrence under the 
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facility (without inclusion of any amounts
utilized pursuant to the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facility) and then calculating the incurrence under the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facility and (C) unless the
Borrower Representative elects otherwise, all or any portion of Incremental Equivalent Debt originally designated as incurred under the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facility or the
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facility shall automatically be deemed to have been incurred under the 
Ratio-Based
 Incremental Facility from and after the first date on
which the Borrowers would be permitted to incur all or such portion, as applicable, of the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness under the 
Ratio-Based
 Incremental Facility (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall have the effect of increasing the 
Cash-Capped
 Incremental Facility or the 
Prepayment-Based
 Incremental Facility, as applicable, by the Dollar Amount of
such redesignated Incremental Equivalent Debt). The Borrowers may appoint any Person as arranger of such Incremental Equivalent Debt (such Person (who may be the Administrative Agent, if it so agrees), the “
Incremental Equivalent Debt
Arranger
”). 
(b) As a condition precedent to the incurrence of any Incremental Equivalent Debt pursuant to this
Section
 2.15
, (i) such Incremental Equivalent Debt shall not be Guaranteed by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Loan Party or that does not become a Loan Party (
provided
 that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Incremental Equivalent Debt need not be Guaranteed by all Loan Parties under the other Facilities), (ii) (A) to the extent secured by the Collateral, such Incremental Equivalent Debt shall be subject to the Applicable Intercreditor Arrangements
and (B) to the extent subordinated, such Incremental Equivalent Debt shall be subject to customary subordination provisions reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (iii) such Incremental Equivalent Debt shall have a final
maturity no earlier than the then Latest Maturity Date, 
provided
, that Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt, customary escrow arrangements and Incremental Equivalent Debt in an amount not in excess of the Inside Maturity Basket at the time of
Incurrence may have a maturity date earlier than the Latest Maturity Date, (iv) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Incremental Equivalent Debt shall not be shorter than that of any
then-existing
 Term Loan B Tranche; 
provided
, that, with respect to Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt and Incremental Equivalent Debt in an amount not in excess of the Inside Maturity Basket at the
time of Incurrence, the Weighted Average Life to Maturity thereof may be shorter than the then longest remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any then outstanding Term B Loans, (v) such Incremental Equivalent Debt (other than any
Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt) shall not be subject to any mandatory 
142 
redemption or mandatory prepayment provisions or rights (except to the extent any such mandatory redemption or mandatory prepayment is required to be applied 
pro
rata
 (or greater
than 
pro
rata

pricing, interest rate margins, rate floors, discounts, fees, premiums, prepayment premiums and optional prepayment and optional redemption terms) of such Incremental Equivalent Debt are, taken as a whole, not materially more favorable to the
creditors providing such Incremental Equivalent Debt than those applicable to the Facilities (taken as a whole) (as reasonably determined by the Borrower Representative in good faith) unless such provisions shall be customary for similar debt
securities or loans in light of then-prevailing market terms and conditions (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence (as reasonably determined by the Borrower Representative in good faith) (it being understood that (A) no Incremental
Equivalent Debt in the form of term loans or notes shall include any financial maintenance covenants, but that customary 
cross-acceleration
 provisions may be included and (B) any negative covenants with
respect to indebtedness, investments, liens or restricted payments shall be 
incurrence-based;
provided
, that any such negative covenants applicable to Extendable Bridge Loans/Interim Debt may be
maintenance covenants) (
provided
 that, at the Parent Borrower’s option, delivery of a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Parent Borrower to the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger in good faith at least three Business Days (or
such shorter period as may be agreed by the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger) prior to the incurrence of such Incremental Equivalent Debt, together with a reasonably detailed description of the material terms and conditions of such Incremental
Equivalent Debt or drafts of the documentation relating thereto, stating that the Parent Borrower has determined in good faith that such terms and conditions satisfy the requirement set forth in this 
clause (b)
, shall be conclusive evidence
that such terms and conditions satisfy such requirement unless the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger provides notice to the Parent Borrower of its objection during such three Business Day period (including a reasonable description of the basis
upon which it objects)); 
provided
, 
however
, that such Incremental Equivalent Debt may provide for any additional or different financial or other covenants or other provisions that (1) are agreed among the Borrowers and the
creditors thereof and applicable only during periods after the then Latest Maturity Date in effect or (2) are incorporated into this Agreement (or any other applicable Loan Document) for the benefit of all existing Lenders (to the extent
applicable to such Lender) by an amendment to this Agreement (which may be accomplished without further Lender voting requirements)). Subject to the foregoing, the conditions precedent to each such incurrence shall be agreed to by the creditors
providing such Incremental Equivalent Debt and the Borrowers. 
(c) The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the
Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger to execute and deliver such amendments) to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with the Borrowers as may be necessary in order to secure any Incremental Equivalent Debt with the Collateral and/or to make such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent
and the Borrowers in connection with the incurrence of such Incremental Equivalent Debt, in each case on terms consistent with this 
Section
 2.15
. If the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger is not the Administrative Agent,
the actions authorized to be taken by the Incremental Equivalent Debt Arranger herein shall be done in consultation with the Administrative Agent and, with respect to applicable documentation (including amendments to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents), any comments to such documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent shall be reflected therein. 
Section 2.16 
Cash Collateral

(a) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer under any Revolving Tranche (i) if the applicable L/C
Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit issued under such Tranche and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing or (ii) if, 
143 
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding under such Tranche, the Borrowers shall, in each case, promptly deliver to the Administrative
Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover 103% of the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C
Issuer, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover 103% of all Fronting Exposure of such Defaulting Lender after giving effect to 
Section
 2.17(a)(iv)
 and any
Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender. 
(b) All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to
deposit) shall be maintained in blocked deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent (or other financial institution selected by any of them). The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby
grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the applicable L/C Issuer and the Revolving Credit Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security
interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be
applied pursuant to 
Section
 2.16(c)
. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent as herein provided or that the
total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrowers and the relevant Defaulting Lender shall, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the
Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this 
Section
 2.16
 or 
Sections 
2.03
, 
2.05

obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein. 
(d) Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly
following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to such release) or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as
appropriate, its assignee following compliance with 
Section
 10.07(b)(viii)
)) or (ii) the Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; 
provided
, 
however
,
(x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of a Default under 
Sections 8.01(a)

provided in this 
Section
 2.16
 may be otherwise applied in accordance with

Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. 
Section 2.17

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law: 
(i) That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this
Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in 
Section

Lender pursuant to 
Section

Administrative Agent hereunder; 
second
, to the payment on a 
pro rata
 basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuers hereunder; 
third
, if so reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or reasonably
requested by the any L/C Issuer, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Letter of Credit;

Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; 
fifth

Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a 
non-interest
 bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;

(g)
 exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any 
non-appealable
 judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against that Defaulting
Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and 
eighth
, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; 
provided
 that if (x) such
payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set
forth in 
Section
 4.02
 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all 
Non-Defaulting
 Lenders on a 
pro rata
basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a
Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this 
Section
 2.17(a)(ii)
 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
(iii) That Defaulting Lender (x) shall not be entitled to receive any commitment fee pursuant to
Section
 2.09(a)
 for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting
Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit fees as provided in 
Section
 2.03(h)
. 
(iv) During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each 
Non-Defaulting
 Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to 
Section
 2.03
, the Pro Rata Share of each
Non-Defaulting
 Lender under a Revolving Tranche shall be determined without giving effect to the Commitment under such Revolving Tranche of that Defaulting Lender; 
provided
 that the aggregate obligation
of each 
Non-Defaulting
 Lender under a Revolving Tranche to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit issued under such Revolving Tranche shall not exceed the positive difference, if any,
of (1) the Commitment under such Revolving Tranche of such 
Non-Defaulting
 Lender minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Loans under such Revolving Tranche of such 
Non-Defaulting
 Lender. 
145 
(b) If the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and each L/C Issuer agree in writing in their
sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set
forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit to be held on a 
pro rata
 basis by the Lenders in accordance with their ratable shares (without giving effect to the
application of 
Section
 2.17(a)(iv)

payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and 
provided
, 
further
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender
to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.

those delivered on the Closing Date under 
Section

 or delivered from time to time pursuant to 
Section
 6.12
 and/or 
Section
 6.16
 (other than changes to such legal
opinions resulting from a change in Law, change in fact or change to counsel’s form of opinion). The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Specified Refinancing Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents with the Borrowers as may be necessary in order to establish new Tranches of Specified Refinancing Debt and to make such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and
the Specified Refinancing Agent and the Borrowers in connection with the establishment of such new Tranches, in each case on terms consistent with and/or to effect the provisions of this 
Section
 2.18

(c) Each class of Specified Refinancing Debt incurred under this 
Section
 2.18

amount that is (x) not less $1,000,000 and (y) an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Any Refinancing Amendment may provide for the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrowers in respect of a Revolving
Tranche pursuant to any revolving credit facility established thereby, in each case on terms substantially equivalent to the terms applicable to Letters of Credit under the Revolving Credit Commitments. 
(d) The Specified Refinancing Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Refinancing Amendment. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Refinancing Amendment, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Specified Refinancing Debt
incurred pursuant thereto (including the addition of such Specified Refinancing Debt as separate “Facilities” hereunder and treated in a manner consistent with the Facilities being refinanced, including for purposes of prepayments and
voting). Any Refinancing Amendment may, without the consent of any Person other than the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Specified Refinancing Agent and the Lenders providing such Specified Refinancing Debt, effect such amendments to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Specified Refinancing Agent and the Borrowers, to effect the provisions of or consistent with this
Section
 2.18

Revolving Tranche shall be reallocated from Lenders holding Revolving Credit Commitments to Lenders holding extended revolving commitments in accordance with the terms of such Refinancing Amendment; 
provided
, 
however
, that such
participation interests shall, upon receipt thereof by the relevant Lenders holding extended revolving commitments, be deemed to be participation interests in respect of such extended revolving commitments and the terms of such participation
interests (including the commission applicable thereto) shall be adjusted accordingly. If the Specified Refinancing Agent is not the Administrative Agent, the actions authorized to be taken by the Specified Refinancing Agent herein shall be done in
consultation with the Administrative Agent and, with respect to the preparation of any documentation necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this

(e) To the extent any Guarantee or security granted prior to the date of incurrence under
this 
Section
 2.18
 to support the Obligations in any jurisdiction requires application, registration, filing or equivalent perfection requirements to be taken in such jurisdiction for any Specified Refinancing Debt which the
applicable Borrower and the lenders under such facility desire to benefit on a 
pari passu
 basis from such Guarantees and/or such security are not obtained prior to such incurrence, such inability to complete such application, registration,
filing or equivalent perfection requirements shall not be deemed to adversely impact the 
pari passu
 nature of such Specified Refinancing Debt hereunder and the relevant provisions of this Agreement (including
Section
 2.03
 and 
8.04
) shall be interpreted as if such Specified Refinancing Debt benefit from such Guarantee or security. 
Section 2.19

Debt Exchange Notes (each such exchange a “
Permitted Debt Exchange

Permitted Debt Exchange Notes may include accrued interest and premium (if any) under the Term Loans exchanged and underwriting discounts, fees, commissions and Refinancing Expenses in connection with the issuance of such Permitted Debt Exchange
Notes, (iii) the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of all Term Loans exchanged by the Borrowers pursuant to any Permitted Debt Exchange shall automatically be cancelled and retired by the Borrowers on the date
of the settlement thereof (and, if requested by the Administrative Agent, any applicable exchanging Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, or such other form as may be reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent, in respect thereof pursuant to which the respective Lender assigns its interest in the Term Loans being exchanged pursuant to the Permitted Debt Exchange to the Borrowers for immediate cancellation), (iv) if the aggregate
principal amount of all Term Loans (calculated on the face amount thereof) tendered by Lenders in respect of the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer (with no Lender being permitted to tender a principal amount of Term Loans which exceeds the
principal amount thereof actually held by it) shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans offered to be exchanged by the Borrowers pursuant to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer, then the Borrowers shall exchange Term
Loans subject to such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer tendered by such Lenders ratably up to such maximum amount based on the respective principal amounts so tendered, (v) all documentation in respect of such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be
consistent with the foregoing, and all written communications generally directed to the Lenders in connection therewith shall be in form and substance consistent with the foregoing and made in consultation with the Borrowers and the Exchange Agent

(b) With respect to all Permitted Debt
Exchanges effected by the Borrowers pursuant to this 
Section
 2.19
, (i) such Permitted Debt Exchanges (and the cancellation of the exchanged Term Loans in connection therewith) shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory
payments or prepayments for purposes of 
Section
 2.05(a)
 or (b), and (ii) such Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall be made for not less than $1,000,000 (or the equivalent Dollar Amount) in aggregate principal amount of

minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Permitted Debt Exchange Offer in the Borrowers’ discretion) of Term Loans of any or all applicable Classes be tendered. 
149 
(c) In connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, the Borrowers and the Exchange Agent
shall mutually agree to such procedures as may be necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this 
Section
 2.19
 and without conflict with 
Section
 2.19(d)

provided
 that the terms of
any Permitted Debt Exchange Offer shall provide that the date by which the relevant Lenders are required to indicate their election to participate in such Permitted Debt Exchange shall be not less than a reasonable period (in the discretion of the
Borrowers and the Exchange Agent) of time following the date on which the Permitted Debt Exchange Offer is made. 
(d) The Borrowers shall
be responsible for compliance with, and hereby agrees to comply with, all applicable securities and other laws and regulations in connection with each Permitted Debt Exchange, it being understood and agreed that (x) none of the Exchange Agent,

Additional Alternative Currencies
. 
(a) Any Borrower may from time to time request that Revolving Credit Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than
those specifically listed in the definition of “Alternative Currency”; 
provided
 that such requested currency is a lawful currency that is readily available and freely transferable and convertible into Euros or Dollars. In the case
of any such request, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and, with respect to the making of Revolving Credit Loans, the Revolving Credit Lenders; and, in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance
of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer. 
(b) Any
such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. ten Business Days prior to the date of the desired Borrowing (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such
request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Revolving Credit Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender
thereof and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the relevant L/C Issuer. Each such Revolving Credit Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Revolving Credit
Loans) or the L/C Issuer (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., five Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to
the making of Revolving Credit Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in the requested currency. 
150 
Any failure by any Revolving Credit Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to respond
to such request within the time period specified in the preceding 
paragraph (b)
 shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Revolving Credit Lender, L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to permit Revolving Credit Loans to be made or Letters of
Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Revolving Credit Lenders that would be obligated to make Revolving Credit Loans denominated in such requested currency consent to making Revolving Credit Loans
in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower Representative and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings of Revolving Credit
Loans; and if the Administrative Agent and the relevant L/C Issuer consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Borrower Representative and such currency shall thereupon be
deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances. In connection with any such consent to make Revolving Credit Loans and/or Letters of Credit in such requested currency, (i) this
Administrative Agent and such Revolving Credit Lenders or L/C Issuers, as applicable, may amend this Agreement to the extent necessary to add the applicable rate for such currency and (ii) to the extent this Agreement reflects the appropriate
interest rate for such currency or has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency or has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an
Alternative Currency for purposes of any Borrowings of Term Benchmark Loans, RFR Loans or Letter of Credit issuances in such Alternative Currency. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain the requisite consent to any request for an
additional currency under this 
Section
 2.20
, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Borrower Representative.

Section 2.22 
Extension of Term Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments

(a) The Borrowers may at any time and from time to time request that all or a portion of the (i) Term Loans of one or more Tranches
existing at the time of such request (each, an “
Existing Term Tranche
”, and the Term Loans of such Tranche, the “
Existing Term Loans
”) or (ii) Revolving Credit Commitments of one or more Tranches existing
at the time of such request (each, an “
Existing Revolving Tranche
” and together with the Existing Term Tranches, each an “
Existing Tranche
”, and the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Existing Revolving
Tranche, the “
Existing Revolving Loans
”, and together with the Existing Term Loans, the “
Existing Loans
”), in each case, be converted to extend the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with
respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of any Existing Tranche (any such Existing Tranche which has been so extended, an “
Extended Term Tranche
” or “
Extended Revolving Tranche
”, as applicable, and
each an “
Extended Tranche
”, and the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, of such Extended Tranches, the “
Extended Term Loans
” or “
Extended Revolving Commitments
”, as
applicable, and collectively, the “
Extended Loans
”) and to provide for other terms consistent with this 
Section
 2.22
; 
provided
 that (i) any such request shall be made by the Parent Borrower to
each Lender under the applicable Tranche on a 
pro rata
 basis (based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans or on the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments) with respect to such requested Lenders and (ii) any
applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied unless waived by the Parent Borrower in its sole discretion. In order to establish any Extended Tranche, the Parent Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (in such
capacity, the “
Extended Loans Agent
”) (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the requested Lenders of the applicable Existing Tranche) (an “
Extension Request
”) setting forth the proposed terms of
the Extended Tranche to be established, which terms shall be substantially similar to those applicable to the Existing Tranche from which they are to be extended (the “
Specified Existing Tranche
”), except (x) all or any of
the final maturity dates of such Extended Tranches shall be delayed to later dates than the final maturity dates of the Specified Existing Tranche, (y) (A) the interest margins with respect to the Extended Tranche may be higher or lower than
the interest margins for the Specified Existing Tranche and/or (B) additional fees may be payable to 
151 
the Lenders providing such Extended Tranche in addition to or in lieu of any increased margins contemplated by the preceding 
clause (A)
 and (z) in the case of an Extended Term
Tranche, so long as the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Extended Tranche would be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Specified Existing Tranche, amortization rates with respect to the Extended Term
Tranche may be higher or lower than the amortization rates for the Specified Existing Tranche, in each case to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; 
provided
 that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section
 2.22
 or otherwise, assignments and participations of Extended Tranches shall be governed by the same or, at the Borrowers’ discretion, more restrictive assignment and participation provisions applicable to
Initial Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, set forth in 
Section
 10.07
. No requested Lender shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Existing Loans converted into an Extended Tranche
pursuant to any Extension Request. Any Extended Tranche shall constitute a separate Tranche of Loans from the Specified Existing Tranches and from any other Existing Tranches (together with any other Extended Tranches so established on such date).
On the Extension Date applicable to any applicable Revolving Tranche under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Borrowers shall prepay the Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances (to the extent participated to Revolving Credit Lenders) outstanding on
such Extension Date applicable to the relevant Revolving Tranche (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to 
Section
 3.06
) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances (to
the extent participated to Revolving Credit Lenders), as the case may be, applicable to the 
non-extending
 Revolving Credit Lenders under such Revolving Tranche in accordance with any revised Pro Rata Share of
a Revolving Credit Lender in respect of the extended Revolving Credit Facility arising from any 
non-ratable
 Extension to the Revolving Credit Commitments under this 
Section
 2.22
. 
(b) The Parent Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least ten Business Days (or such shorter period as the Extended
Loans Agent may agree in its sole discretion) prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Tranche or Existing Tranches are requested to respond. Any requested Lender (an “
Extending Lender
”) wishing to have all
or a portion of its Specified Existing Tranche converted into an Extended Tranche shall notify the Extended Loans Agent (each, an “
Extension Election
”) on or prior to the date specified in such Extension Request of the amount of
its Specified Existing Tranche that it has elected to convert into an Extended Tranche. In the event that the aggregate amount of the Specified Existing Tranche subject to Extension Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Tranches requested
pursuant to the Extension Request, the Specified Existing Tranches subject to Extension Elections shall be converted to Extended Tranches on a 
pro rata
 basis based on the amount of Specified Existing Tranches included in each such Extension
Election. In connection with any extension of Loans pursuant to this 
Section
 2.22
 (each, an “
Extension
”), the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and Extended Loans Agent shall agree to such procedures
regarding timing, rounding, lender revocation and other administrative adjustments to ensure reasonable administrative management of the credit facilities hereunder after such Extension, in each case acting reasonably to accomplish the purposes of
this

 and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in 
Section
 10.01
, shall not require the consent of any Lender other than the Extending Lenders with respect to the Extended Tranches established thereby) executed by the Loan Parties, the

 Additional Amendments (as defined below), any Extension Amendment may provide for additional terms and/or additional amendments other than those referred to or contemplated above (any such additional amendment,
a “
Section
 2.22 Additional Amendment
”) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; 
provided
 that such 
Section
 2.22
 Additional Amendments do not become effective prior to the
time that such 
Section
 2.22
 Additional Amendments have been consented to (including pursuant to consents applicable to holders of any Extended Tranches provided for in any Extension Amendment) by such of the Lenders, Loan
Parties and other parties (if any) as may be required in order for such 
Section
 2.22
 Additional Amendments to become effective in accordance with 
Section
 10.01
; 
provided
, 
further
,
that no Extension Amendment may provide for (i) any Extended Tranche to be secured by any Collateral or other assets of any Loan Party that does not also secure the Existing Tranches or be guaranteed by any Person other than the Guarantors and
(ii) so long as any Existing Term Tranches are outstanding, any mandatory prepayment provisions that do not also apply to the Existing Term Tranches (other than Existing Term Tranches secured on a junior basis by the Collateral or ranking
junior in right of payment, which shall be subject to junior prepayment provisions) on a 
pro rata
 or otherwise more favorable basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
Section
 10.01
, any such Extension
Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to any Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Extended Loans Agent, to
effect the provisions of this 
Section
 2.22
; 
provided
 that the foregoing shall not constitute a consent on behalf of any Lender to the terms of any 
Section
 2.22
 Additional Amendment. The
Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent and the Extended Loans Agent to enter into amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Borrowers as may be necessary in order to establish any Extended Loans and to make such
technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Extended Loans Agent and the Borrowers in connection with the establishment of such Extended Loans, in each case on terms consistent
with and/or to effect the provisions of this 
Section

. 
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, on any date on which any Existing Tranche is converted to extend the related scheduled maturity date(s) in accordance with 
clause (a)
 above (an “
Extension Date
”), in the case of the
Specified Existing Tranche of each Extending Lender, the aggregate principal amount of such Specified Existing Tranche shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of Extended Tranche so converted by such Lender on
such date, and such Extended Tranches shall be established as a separate Tranche from the Specified Existing Tranche and from any other Existing Tranches (together with any other Extended Tranches so established on such date). 
(e) If, in connection with any proposed Extension Amendment, any requested Lender declines to consent to the applicable extension on the terms
and by the deadline set forth in the applicable Extension Request (each such other Lender, a “
Non
-Extending
 Lender
”) then the Borrowers may, on notice to the Extended Loans Agent and
the 
Non-Extending
 Lender, replace such 
Non-Extending
 Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign pursuant to
Section
 10.07
 (with the assignment fee and any other costs and expenses to be paid by the Borrowers in such instance) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees; 
provided
 that
neither the Extended Loans Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrowers to find a replacement Lender; 
provided
, 
further
, that the applicable assignee shall have agreed to provide Extended Loans on the terms set forth
in such Extension Amendment; 
provided
, 
further
, that all obligations of the Borrowers owing to the 
Non-Extending
 Lender relating to the Existing Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the
assignee Lender to such 
Non-Extending
 Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Assumption. In connection with any such replacement under this 
Section
 2.22
, if the 
Non-Extending
 Lender does not execute and deliver to the Extended Loans Agent a duly completed Assignment and Assumption by the later of (A) the date on which the replacement Lender executes and delivers such
Assignment and Assumption and (B) the date as of 
153 
which all obligations of the Borrowers owing to the 
Non-Extending
 Lender relating to the Existing Loans so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee
Lender to such 
Non-Extending
 Lender, then such 
Non-Extending
 Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption as of such date and the
Borrowers shall be entitled (but not obligated) to execute and deliver such Assignment and Assumption on behalf of such 
Non-Extending
 Lender. 
(f) Following any Extension Date, with the written consent of the Parent Borrower, any 
Non-Extending
Lender may elect to have all or a portion of its Existing Loans deemed to be an Extended Loan under the applicable Extended Tranche on any date (each date a “
Designation Date
”) prior to the maturity date of such Extended Tranche;
provided
 that such Lender shall have provided written notice to the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Extended Loans Agent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such Designation Date (or such shorter period as the
Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion). Following a Designation Date, the Existing Loans held by such Lender so elected to be extended will be deemed to be Extended Loans of the applicable Extended Tranche, and any Existing
Loans held by such Lender not elected to be extended, if any, shall continue to be “Existing Loans” of the applicable Tranche. 
(g) With respect to all Extensions consummated by the Borrowers pursuant to this 
Section
 2.22
, (i) such Extensions
shall not constitute optional or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of 
Sections 2.05(a)
 and 
(b)
 and (ii) no Extension Request is required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment; 
provided
 that the
Parent Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “
Minimum Extension Condition
”) to consummating any such Extension that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Extension Request in the Parent
Borrower’s sole discretion and may be waived by the Parent Borrower) of Existing Loans of any or all applicable Tranches be extended. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this
Section
 2.22
 (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment of any interest, fees or premium in respect of any Extended Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Request) and hereby waive the
requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including 
Sections 2.05(a)
 and 
(b)
 and 2.07) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this
Section
 2.22
. 
ARTICLE III. 
TAXES, INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES, INCREASED COSTS PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 
Section 3.01 
Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding
of any Tax from or in respect of any such payment, then the Borrowers, the other applicable Loan Party, Administrative Agent or other applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full
amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Borrower, or other applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary
so that after all such deductions or withholdings have been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this 
Section
 3.01
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
154 
(b) In addition but without duplication, the Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
(c) The Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount
of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this 
Section
 3.01
) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a
payment to such Recipient and any reasonable 
out-of-pocket
 expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Any Recipient claiming indemnity pursuant to this 
clause (c)
 shall notify the Loan Parties of the imposition of the relevant Indemnified Taxes as soon as practicable
after the Recipient becomes aware of such imposition. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or
on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
(d) Within 30 days after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to this 
Section
 3.01
, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a
copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
(e) If
any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this 
Section
 3.01
 (including by the payment of
additional amounts pursuant to this 
Section
 3.01
), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made and additional amounts paid under this
Section
 3.01
 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all 
out-of-pocket
 expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall promptly repay to such indemnified
party the amount paid over pursuant to this 
clause (e)
 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
clause (e)
, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this 
clause (e)
 the payment of which
would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net 
after-Tax
 position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This 
clause (e)
 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its
Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
(f) Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of 
Section
 3.01(a)
 or
(c)
 with respect to such Lender it will, if requested by the Borrowers, use commercially reasonable efforts (subject to such Lender’s overall internal policies of general application and legal and regulatory restrictions) to avoid
or reduce to the greatest extent possible any indemnification or additional amounts being due under this 
Section
 3.01
, including to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event;
provided
 that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and 
provided
further
that nothing in this 
Section
 3.01
(f)
 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrowers or the rights of such Lender pursuant to 
Sections 3.01(a)
 and 
(c)
. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay
all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender as a result of a request by the Borrowers under this 
Section
 3.01
(f)
. 
155 
(g) 
(i) Any Recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to any payments made
under any Loan Document shall deliver to the applicable Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Recipient, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Recipient is subject
to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section
 3.01(g)(ii)(A)
, 
(ii)(B)
 and 
(ii)(D)
 below) shall not be required if in the Recipient’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Recipient to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Recipient. 
(ii)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
(A) any Recipient that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the applicable
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Recipient becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request

Exhibit I
-1
 to the effect that such
Non-U.S.
 Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrowers within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and that no payments in connection with any Loan Document are effectively connected with such Lender’s

”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form 
W-8BEN
 or IRS Form 
W-8BEN-E,
 as applicable (or any successor form); or 
(4) to the extent a

fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Recipient shall deliver to the applicable Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at
the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of
the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA to determine
whether such Recipient has complied with such Recipient’s obligations under FATCA and, if necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this 
clause (D)
, “FATCA” shall
include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date; and 
157 
(E) the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrowers (in such number
of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which the Administrative Agent becomes the administrative agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of

it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall promptly update and deliver such form or certification to the applicable Borrowers and the Administrative Agent or promptly notify the applicable Borrowers
and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal ineligibility to do so. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section

, a Lender shall not be required to deliver any documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver. 
(h) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes
attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to
such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of

Currency) or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Term Benchmark Rate or Adjusted Daily Simple RFR, as applicable, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of any Lender to purchase or sell, or
to take deposits of, Dollars or any other Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, in each case after the Closing Date, then, on written notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower Representative through the Administrative Agent,

Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” with respect to any Alternative Currency for such Benchmark
Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any 
160 
Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment
to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders of each affected Class. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Borrower Representative, to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any
amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower Representative and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to 
clause
(e)

Section
 3.04

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the
implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate or EURIBOR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service
that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of
information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such

non-representative
 tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to 
clause (
i
)
 above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information
service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative

revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, either (x) the
Borrowers will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing denominated in Dollars into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR
for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) Base Rate Loans if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) any request relating to a Term
Benchmark Borrowing or RFR Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency other than Dollars shall be ineffective. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an

Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Alternative Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower Representative’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant
Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement for such Alternative Currency is implemented pursuant to this 
Section
 3.04
, (i) if such Loan is denominated in
Dollars, (1) with respect to any Term Benchmark Loan, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in
Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) Base Rate Loan denominated in Dollars if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a
Benchmark Transition Event, on such day, and (2) with respect to any RFR Loan, such Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute a Base Rate Loan, and (ii) if such Loan is denominated in
any Alternative Currency other than Dollars, (1) with respect to any Term Benchmark Loan, such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative
Currency plus the CBR Spread; 
provided
 that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency cannot be
determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Alternative Currency other than Dollars shall, at the Borrower Representative’s election on or prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the Borrowers on such day or
(B) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in any Alternative Currency other than Dollars shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in
Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time and (2) with respect to any RFR Loan, such Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable
Alternative Currency plus the CBR Spread; 
provided
 that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Alternative Currency
cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans shall, at the Borrower Representative’s election: (A) be converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount of such Alternative Currency)
immediately or (B) be promptly prepaid in full.

interpretation of any Law, in each case after the Closing Date, or such Lender’s compliance therewith, there shall be any material increase in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Loan the interest
on which is determined by reference to a Term Benchmark Rate or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a material reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in connection with any of the foregoing
(including Taxes on or in respect of its loans, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, but excluding for purposes of this
Section

Section
 3.01
, (ii) Taxes described in 
clauses (b)
 through
(d)
 in the definition of Excluded Taxes, (iii) Connection Income Taxes and (iv) reserve requirements reflected in any Term Benchmark Rate, then within 15 days after demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail such
increased costs (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with 
Section
 3.06
), the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
increased cost or reduction. 
162 
(b) If any Lender reasonably determines that the introduction of or any change in or in the
interpretation any Law regarding capital adequacy and liquidity requirements or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the Closing Date, or compliance by such Lender (or its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect
of materially reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy
and such Lender’s desired return on capital as of the Closing Date or the date it becomes a Lender hereunder), then within 15 days after demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of such reduced
rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with 
Section
 3.06
), the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction. 
(c) The Borrowers shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves or
liquidity with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Term Benchmark Rate funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, as applicable equal to the actual costs of
such reserves or liquidity allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply
with any liquidity requirement, reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Term Benchmark Loans or
RFR Loans, as applicable, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined
by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; 
provided
 the Borrowers shall have received at
least 15 days’ prior written notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give written notice fifteen days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such
additional interest or cost shall be due and payable 15 days from receipt of such written notice.

therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or
foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall, in each case, be deemed to have gone into effect after the Closing Date, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued. 
Section 3.06 
Funding Losses

of any Term Benchmark Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or an optional or mandatory prepayment of Loans), (ii) the conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan other than
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term Benchmark Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be

Borrower pursuant to 
Section
 3.08

scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency, then, in any such event, such Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (other than any lost profits) attributable to such event. In the case of a Term
Benchmark Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had
such event not occurred, at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, as applicable, that would have been applicable to such 
163 
Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that
would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (y) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,
for deposits in the applicable Alternative Currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such Alternative Currency, whether or not such Term Benchmark Loan was in fact so funded;
provided, however, that such Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender for any costs of terminating or liquidating any hedge or trading position (including any rate swap, basis swap, forward rate transaction, interest rate option, cap,
collar or floor transaction, or any similar transaction). A certificate of any Lender setting forth the computation in reasonable detail of any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to
the Borrower Representative and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 
With respect to RFR Loans, in the event of (i) the payment of any principal of any RFR Loan other than on the Interest Payment Date applicable thereto
(including as a result of an Event of Default or an optional or mandatory prepayment of Loans), (ii) the failure to borrow or prepay any RFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be
revoked under 
Section
 2.05(a)
 and is revoked in accordance therewith), (iii) the assignment of any RFR Loan other than on the Interest Payment Date applicable thereto as a result of a request by any Borrower pursuant to
Section
 3.08

payment thereof in a different currency, then, in any such event, such Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (other than any lost profits) attributable to such event. A certificate of any Lender setting forth the
computation in reasonable detail of any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower Representative and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof. 
For the purposes of calculating the amounts payable
under this Section 3.06, any “floor” requirement reflected in the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR shall be disregarded. 
Section 3.07 
Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation
. 
(a) A certificate of any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this 
Article III
 and setting forth in reasonable detail a
calculation of the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. With
respect to any Lender’s claim for compensation under 
Section
 3.03
, 
3.04
 or 
3.05
, the Loan Parties shall not be required to compensate such Lender for any amount incurred more than 180 days prior to the
date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the event that gives rise to such claim; 
provided
 that, if the circumstance giving rise to such claim is retroactive, then such 
180-day
 period referred to
above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under
Section
 3.05
, or the Borrowers are required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section
 3.01

Section
 3.03
, then such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, will, if requested by the Borrowers and at the Borrowers’ expense,
use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit affected by such event; 
provided
 that such efforts (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts
164 
payable pursuant to 
Section
 3.01
, 
3.0
3
 or 
3.0
5
, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not, in the judgment of such Lender or such
L/C Issuer, as applicable, be inconsistent with the internal policies of, or otherwise be disadvantageous in any material legal, economic or regulatory respect to such Lender or its Lending Office or such L/C Issuer. The provisions of this 
clause
(b)
 shall not affect or postpone any Obligations of the Borrowers or rights of such Lender pursuant to 
Section
 3.05

Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or continue from one Interest Period to another Term Benchmark Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term Benchmark Loans, until the event or
condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of 
Section
 3.07(e)
 shall be applicable); 
provided
 that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive
the compensation so requested for any amounts so accrued prior to such suspension. 
(d) If the obligation of any Lender to make or
continue from one Interest Period to another any Term Benchmark Loan, or to convert Base Rate Loans into Term Benchmark Loans shall be suspended pursuant to 
Section
 3.04
 hereof, such Lender’s Term Benchmark Loans
shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or CBR Loans denominated in Euros, as applicable, on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Term Benchmark Loans (or, in the case of an immediate
conversion required by 
Section
 3.03
, on such earlier date as required by Law) and, unless and until (i) establishment of a Benchmark Replacement or (ii) such Lender gives notice as provided below that the
circumstances specified in 
Section
 3.03
, 
3.04
 or 
3.05
 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist: 
(i) to the extent that such Lender’s Term Benchmark Loans have been so converted, all payments and prepayments of
principal that would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s Term Benchmark Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans or CBR Loans, as applicable; and 
(ii) all Loans that would otherwise be made or continued from one Interest Period to another by such Lender as Term Benchmark
Loans shall be made or continued instead as Base Rate Loans or CBR Loans, as applicable, and all Base Rate Loans or CBR Loans, as applicable, of such Lender that would otherwise be converted into Term Benchmark Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans
or CBR Loans, as applicable. 
(e) If any Lender gives notice to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) that the
circumstances specified in 
Section
 3.03
, 
3.04
 or 
3.05
 hereof that gave rise to the conversion of such Lender’s Term Benchmark Loans pursuant to 
Section
 3.0
4
 no longer
exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Term Benchmark Loans made by other Lenders are outstanding, such Lender’s Base Rate Loans and/or CBR Loans, as applicable, shall be
automatically converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Term Benchmark Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding Term Benchmark
Loans and by such Lender are held 
pro rata
 (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments. 
(f) A Lender shall not be entitled to any compensation pursuant to the foregoing sections to the extent such Lender is not imposing such
charges or requesting such compensation from borrowers (similarly situated to the Borrowers hereunder) under comparable syndicated credit facilities.

described in 
Section
 3.03
 or 
3.04
, (ii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or (iii) any Lender becomes a 
Non-Consenting
 Lender (as defined below in this
Section
 3.08
) (collectively, a “
Replaceable Lender
”), then the Borrowers may, on one Business Day’s prior written notice from the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent and such Lender (for the
avoidance of doubt, such notice shall be deemed provided on the same day that an amendment or waiver is posted to Lenders for consent), either (x) replace such Lender by causing such Lender to (and such Lender shall be obligated to) assign
pursuant to 
Section
 10.07(b)
 (with the assignment fee to be paid by the Borrowers in such instance unless waived by the Administrative Agent) all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, in the case of a 
Non-Consenting
 Lender, all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Facility or Facilities for which its consent is required) to one or more Eligible Assignees; 
provided
 that
none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrowers to find a replacement Lender or other such Person or (y) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, terminate the
Commitment of such Lender or L/C Issuer or prepay the Loans, as the case may be, and (1) in the case of a Lender (other than an L/C Issuer), repay all Obligations of the Borrowers owing (and the amount of all accrued interest and fees in
respect thereof) to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date and (2) in the case of an L/C Issuer, repay all obligations of the Borrowers owing to such L/C Issuer relating to the Loans
and participations held by such L/C Issuer as of such termination date and cancel or backstop on terms satisfactory to such L/C Issuer any Letters of Credit issued by it; 
provided
 that (i) in the case of any such replacement of, or
termination of Commitments with respect to a 
Non-Consenting
 Lender such replacement or termination shall be sufficient (together with all other consenting Lenders including any other replacement Lender) to
cause the adoption of the applicable modification, waiver or amendment of the Loan Documents and (ii) in the case of any such replacement as a result of Borrowers having become obligated to pay amounts described in
Section
 3.01
 or 
3.05
, such replacement would eliminate or reduce payments pursuant to 
Section
 3.01
 or 
3.05

Section
 3.08(a)
 shall (i) execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations and (ii) subject to 
clause

case may be, of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations, (B) all Obligations relating to the Loans and participations (and the amount of all accrued interest, fees and premiums in
respect thereof) so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such assigning Lender concurrently with such assignment and assumption and (C) upon such payment and, if so requested by the assignee Lender, the assigning Lender

Loans, Commitments and participations, except with respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall survive as to such assigning Lender. In connection with any such replacement, if any such Replaceable Lender does not execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such replacement within two Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such Replaceable
Lender, then such Replaceable Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the Replaceable Lender. In connection with the replacement of any Lender pursuant to this
Section
 3.08(a)
, the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such amounts as may be required pursuant to 
Section
 3.06
. 
166 
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, (i) any Lender that acts
as an L/C Issuer may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless Cash Collateral has been deposited into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements consistent with the
requirements of 
Section
 2.16

back-up
 standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by
an issuer reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (ii) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms
of 
Section
 9.09
. 
(c) In the event that (i) a Borrower or the Administrative Agent has requested the
Lenders to consent to a waiver of any provisions of the Loan Documents or to agree to any amendment or other modification thereto, (ii) the waiver, amendment or modification in question requires the agreement of all affected Lenders in
accordance with the terms of 
Section
 10.01
 or all the Lenders with respect to a certain class of the Loans and (iii) the Required Lenders have agreed to such waiver, amendment or modification, then any Lender who does
not agree to such waiver, amendment or modification, in each case, shall be deemed a “
Non
-Consenting
 Lender
”; 
provided
 that the term
“Non-Consenting
 Lender” shall also include any Lender that rejects (or is deemed to reject) (x) a loan modification offer under 
Section
 10.01
, which loan modification
has been accepted by at least the Majority Lenders of the respective Tranche of Loans whose Loans and/or Commitments are to be extended pursuant to such loan modification, (y) any Lender that does not elect to become a lender in respect of any
Specified Refinancing Debt pursuant to 
Section
 2.18

Section
 2.22
, which Extension has been accepted by at least the Majority Lenders
of the respective Tranche of Loans whose Loans and/or Commitments are to be extended pursuant to such Extension. For the avoidance of doubt, if any applicable Lender shall be deemed a 
Non-Consenting
 Lender and
is required to assign all or any portion of its

exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. 
dollar-denominated
 restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference, as
applicable, of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing
Expenses).

Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties through its officers, directors, agents, employees, or affiliates. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and no Loan
Party shall have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those
expressly set forth herein, nor shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against any Agent. Regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing and without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein
and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties; additionally, each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on based on an
alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer exempts the Administrative Agent from the restrictions pursuant to
Section 181 Civil Code (
B
ü
rgerliches
Gesetzbuch
) and similar restrictions applicable to it pursuant to any other applicable law, in each case to the extent legally possible to such Lender and L/C
Issuer. A Lender and any L/C Issuer which cannot grant such exemption shall notify the Administrative Agent accordingly and, upon request of the Administrative Agent, either act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and/or any other
Loan Document as required pursuant to this Agreement and/or such other Loan Document or grant a special power of attorney to a party acting on its behalf, in a manner that is not prohibited pursuant to Section 181 of the German Civil Code
(
B
ü
rgerliches
Gesetzbuch
) and/or any other applicable laws; provided that the aforementioned German Civil Code (
B
ü
rgerliches
Gesetzbuch
) shall only apply to such Lenders
making Loans and L/C Issuers issuing Letters of Credit, in each case, denominated in Euros. 
216 
(b) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit
issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and such L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agents in this 
Article IX
 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer
in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Agent” as used in this 
Article
IX
 and in the definition of 
“Agent-Related
 Person” included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C
Issuer. 
JPMorgan shall also act as the Collateral Agent under the Loan Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a Lender, L/C
Issuer (if applicable) and a potential Cash Management Bank party to a Secured Cash Management Agreement and/or a potential Hedge Bank party to a Secured Hedge Agreement) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes JPMorgan as Collateral Agent to act
as the agent of (and to hold, enter into, deliver, sign, execute and enforce any security interest, charge or other Lien created by the Collateral Documents for and on behalf of or in trust for) such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and
enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent as
Collateral Agent (and any 
co-agents,
sub-agents
 and 
attorneys-in-fact
 appointed by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to 
Section
 9.02
 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies
thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this 
Article IX
 (including 
Section
 9.07
, as though such
co-agents,
sub-agents
 and 
attorneys-in-fact
 were the Collateral Agent under the Loan
Documents) and 
Section
 10.04
 as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto and all references to Administrative Agent in this 
Article IX
 shall, where applicable, be read as including a reference to the
Collateral Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent as Collateral Agent to execute any and all documents (including releases, payoff letters and similar documents) with
respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto (including any intercreditor agreement), as contemplated by and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and acknowledge and
agree that any such action by any Agent shall bind the Lenders (including in its capacities as a Lender, L/C Issuer (if applicable) and a potential Cash Management Bank party to a Secured Cash Management Agreement and/or a potential Hedge Bank party
to a Secured Hedge Agreement) and each Secured Party ratifies and approves all acts and declarations previously done by the Collateral Agent on such Secured Party’s behalf. 
Section 9.02 
Delegation of Duties
. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties and exercise its rights and powers under

agents, employees or 
attorneys-in-fact
 and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective

non-appealable
 judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The exculpatory provisions of this 
Article IX
 shall apply to any such sub agent and to the 
Agent-Related
 Persons of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as
activities as Administrative Agent.

Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender or L/C Issuer shall not assert any right or claim to the Erroneous Payment,
and hereby waives as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of 
set-off
 or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return
of any Erroneous Payments received, including, without limitation, waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any L/C Issuer under this 
clause
(a)
 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
(2) Without limiting immediately preceding 
clause (i)
,
each Lender and each L/C Issuer hereby further agrees that if it receives an Erroneous Payment from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in
a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Erroneous Payment (an “
Erroneous Payment Notice
”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by an Erroneous Payment
Notice, or (z) that such Lender or L/C Issuer otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part), in each case, an error has been made (and that it is deemed to have knowledge of such error at the
time of receipt of such Erroneous Payment) with respect to such Erroneous Payment, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender or L/C Issuer shall not assert any right or claim to the Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, any claim,
counterclaim, defense or right of 
set-off
 or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payments received, including waiver of any
defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees that, in each such case, it shall promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge (or deemed knowledge) of
such error) notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in all events no later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such
Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds 
219 
(in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender or L/C
Issuer to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from
time to time in effect. 
(3) The Borrowers and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous
Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Lender or L/C Issuer that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender or L/C Issuer
with respect to such amount and (y) an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party unless, for the avoidance of doubt, such Erroneous Payment (or
portion thereof) that is not recovered from such Lender or L/C Issuer is with respect to any funds paid by any Borrower Party to the Administrative Agent, in which case such Erroneous Payment shall be deemed to be an optional prepayment of the
Obligations owed to such Lender or L/C Issuer paid in accordance with this Agreement. 
(4) Each party’s obligations
under this Section 9.03(e) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of title or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction
or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document. 
Section 9.04 
Reliance by Agents
. 
(a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, request, consent, certificate, instrument, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution statement or other document or
conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and reasonably believed by it to
have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. Each Agent may consult with, and rely
upon (and be fully protected in relying upon), advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or such other number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance) as it deems appropriate and, if it so
requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders, against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or such other number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any instance)
and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. 
Section 9.05
Notice of Default
. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to that Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders, unless that Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or any Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default and stating that such 
220 
notice is a “notice of default.” The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
any Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with 
Article VIII
; 
provided
, 
however
, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received
any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders. 
Section 9.06 
Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agents
. Each Lender acknowledges that no
Agent-Related
 Person has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan
Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any 
Agent-Related
 Person to any Lender as to any matter, including whether
Agent-Related
 Persons have disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related
 Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and
other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any 
Agent-Related
 Person and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it
deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Lenders by any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any 
Agent-Related
 Person. 
Section 9.07 
Indemnification of Agents
. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each Lender shall, on
a ratable basis based on such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of all the Facilities, indemnify upon demand each 
Agent-Related
 Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Loan Party and without
limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), and hold harmless each 
Agent-Related
 Person in each case from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by such 
Agent-Related
 Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such 
Agent-Related
 Person in its capacity as L/C Issuer); 
provided
, 
however
, that no Lender
shall be liable for any Indemnified Liabilities incurred by an 
Agent-Related
 Person to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are determined in a final, 
non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such 
Agent-Related
 Person’s own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct; 
provided
, 
however
, that no action
taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be required by the Loan Documents) shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct for
purposes of this 
Section
 9.07
; 
provided
, 
further
, that to the extent any L/C Issuer is entitled to indemnification under this 
Section
 9.07
 solely in its capacity and role as an L/C
Issuer, only the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be required to indemnify such L/C Issuer under this 
Section
 9.07
 (which indemnity shall be provided by such Lenders based upon their respective Pro Rata Share of the Revolving
Credit Facility). In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this 
Section
 9.07
 shall apply whether or not any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is
brought by any Lender or any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or
out-of-pocket
 expenses 
221 
(including the fees, disbursements and other charges of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification,
amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to
herein, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers; 
provided
 that such reimbursement by the Lenders shall not affect the Borrowers’ continuing reimbursement
obligations with respect thereto; 
provided
further
, that failure of any Lender to indemnify or reimburse the Administrative Agent shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation in respect thereof. The undertaking in this
Section
 9.07
 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent. 
Section 9.08 
Agents in their Individual Capacities
. Any Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for
the account of, accept deposits from, acquire Capital Stock in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though it were not
an Agent or an L/C Issuer hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, an Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that such Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, such Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not an Agent or an L/C Issuer, and the terms “Lender” and “Lenders” include such Agent
in its individual capacity (unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires). 
Section 9.09
Successor Agents
. 
(a) The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may resign as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable, upon 30 days’ written notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders provided that, if at the time of such resignation, there is a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, satisfactory to each of the resigning
Agent, the incoming Agent and the Borrower Representative, each, in its sole discretion, then the resigning Agent, the incoming Agent and the Borrower Representative may agree to waive or shorten the 30 day notice period. If the Administrative
Agent, Collateral Agent or a controlling Affiliate of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent is subject to an 
Agent-Related
 Distress Event, the Borrowers may remove such Agent from such role upon ten
(10) days’ written notice to the Lenders. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall be consented to
by the Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default under 
Section
 8.01(a)
, 
(f)
, or 
(g)
 (which consent of the Borrowers shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation or removal, as applicable, of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (other than to the
extent subject to an 
Agent-Related
 Distress Event), as applicable, may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrowers, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, and the term “Administrative
Agent” or “Collateral Agent,” as applicable, shall mean such successor administrative agent or such successor collateral agent, as applicable, and the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s appointment,
powers and duties as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be terminated. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, the provisions of this 
Article IX
 and 
Sections 
10.04
 and 
10.05
222 
shall continue in effect for its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent
has accepted appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) by the date which is 30 days following the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s (as applicable) notice of resignation or removal,
the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s resignation or removal shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and (i) the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security as bailee, trustee or other applicable capacity until such time as a successor of such Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is appointed) (for the avoidance of doubt any agency fees for the
account of the retiring agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) the date that a successor Agent is appointed), (ii) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent
shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) as provided for above in this 
Section
 9.09
 and
(iii) the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as
applicable) as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto,
and such amendments or supplements to the Collateral Documents, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported to
be granted by the Collateral Documents, the successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges, and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder by a successor or upon the expiration of the 
30-day
 period following
the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s notice of resignation or removal without a successor having been appointed, the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents other than as specifically set forth in 
clause (
i
)

Section
 9.09
(a)
 but the provisions of this 
Article
IX
 and 
Sections 
10.04
 and 
10.05
 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its 
sub-agents
 and their respective
Agent-Related
 Persons in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them solely in respect of the Loan Documents or Obligations, as applicable, while the retiring Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable. At any time the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to 
clause (d)
 of the definition thereof, the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as
applicable) may be removed as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent (as applicable) hereunder at the request of the Borrowers and the Required Lenders. 
(b) Any resignation by or removal of JPMorgan or J.P. Morgan SE as Administrative Agent or JPMorgan as Collateral Agent pursuant to this
Section
 9.09
 shall also constitute its resignation or removal as an L/C Issuer, in which case the resigning or removed L/C Issuer (x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit hereunder and
(y) shall maintain all of its rights as L/C Issuer with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it prior to the date of such resignation or removal. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent hereunder or upon the expiration of the 
30-day
 period following the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent’s notice of resignation or removal without a successor agent having been
appointed, (i) such successor (if any) shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer shall be discharged from all of their respective
duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer (if any) shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make
(or the Borrowers shall enter into) other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

pendency of any receivership, administrative receivership, judicial management, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization (by way of voluntary arrangement, schemes of arrangement or otherwise), arrangement, adjustment, composition or other

whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrowers) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
(A) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and

the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents and their respective agents and counsel, and any other
amounts, in each case, due to the Agents under 
Sections 
2.09
 and

authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any other Agent any plan of reorganization (by way of voluntary arrangement, schemes of arrangement or otherwise), arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any other Agent or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any other Agent in any such proceeding.

Agent’s and the Collateral Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to this
Section

provided 
that absent such confirmation in writing from the Required Lenders, the act of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent making such request shall not prohibit

the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent from releasing or subordinating its interests if it otherwise conclusively relies on a certificate of the Parent Borrower. In each case as
specified in this 
Section

Banks party to a Secured Cash Management Agreement), L/C Issuer and Agent irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrowers’ sole cost and expense, promptly execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as

documentation or information shall be required to be provided by the Borrowers or any Restricted Subsidiary). Each of the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely and shall rely exclusively on such Responsible
Officer’s certification and the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent will be fully exculpated from any liability and shall be fully protected and shall not have any liability whatsoever to any Secured Party as a result of such
reliance or the consummation of any release or subordination. Additionally, the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent shall promptly return any possessory collateral to the Borrowers in connection with the releases of Collateral and Guarantors

litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent deems that by reason of any present or future
Law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, the Administrative Agent and
the Collateral Agent are hereby authorized, to appoint an additional individual or institution selected by them in their sole discretion as a separate trustee, 
co-trustee,
 administrative agent, collateral
agent, administrative 
sub-agent
 or administrative 
co-agent,
 as applicable (any such additional individual or institution being referred to herein individually as a
“
Supplemental Agent
” and collectively as “
Supplemental Agents
”). 
(b) In the event that the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent appoints a Supplemental Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to be
exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by and vest in such Supplemental Agent to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to enable such
Supplemental Agent to exercise such rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the
exercise or performance thereof by such Supplemental Agent shall run to and be enforceable by either the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent or such Supplemental Agent, and (ii) the provisions of this 
Article IX
 and of
Sections 
10.04
 and 
10.05
 (obligating the Borrowers to pay the Administrative Agent’s and the Collateral Agent’s expenses and to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent) that refer to the
Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative Agent and/or
Collateral Agent and/or such Supplemental Agent, as the context may require. 
(c) Should any instrument in writing from the Borrowers or
any other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights, powers, privileges and duties, the Borrowers
shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent. In case any Supplemental Agent, or a successor thereto, shall die,
become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Agent, to the extent permitted by Law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, until the appointment of a new applicable Supplemental Agent. 
Section 9.15 
Intercreditor Agreement
. The
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent are authorized by the Lenders and each other Secured Party to, to the extent required by the terms of the Loan Documents, (i) enter into any intercreditor agreement contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) enter into any Collateral Document, or (iii) make or consent to any filings or take any other actions in connection therewith (and any amendments, amendments and restatements, restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other
modifications to, such agreements in connection with the incurrence by any Loan Party of any Indebtedness 
227 
of such Loan Party that is permitted to be secured pursuant to 
Sections 
7.01
 and 
7.02
 of this Agreement, in order to permit such Indebtedness to be secured by a valid,
perfected lien on the Collateral (with such priority as may be designated by such Loan Party, to the extent such priority is permitted by the Loan Documents)), and the parties hereto acknowledge that any intercreditor agreement, Collateral Document,
consent, filing or other action will be binding upon them. Each Lender and each other Secured Party (a) hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of any intercreditor agreement (if entered into)
and (b) hereby authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into any intercreditor agreement contemplated by this Agreement or Collateral Document (and any amendments, amendments and restatements,
restatements or waivers of or supplements to or other modifications to, such agreements in connection with the incurrence by any Loan Party of any Indebtedness of such Loan Party that is permitted to be secured pursuant to 
Sections
7.01
 and 
7.02
 of this Agreement, in order to permit such Indebtedness to be secured by a valid, perfected lien on the Collateral (with such priority as may be designated by such Loan Party, to the extent such priority is permitted
by the Loan Documents)), and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, if an intercreditor agreement shall be posted to the Lenders not less than five Business
Days before execution thereof and, if the Required Lenders shall not have objected to such changes within five Business Days after such posting, then the Required Lenders shall be deemed (a) to have agreed that the Administrative Agent entry
into such intercreditor agreement is reasonable and to have consented to such intercreditor agreement and to the Administrative Agent’s execution thereof and (b) to have directed the Administrative Agent to execute such agreement. 
Section 9.16 
Acknowledgment
 Regarding any Supported QFCs
. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a
guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Contracts or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “
QFC Credit Support
” and each such QFC a “
Supported QFC
”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows
with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the 
Dodd-Frank
 Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together
with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “
U.S. Special Resolution Regimes
”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any
Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): 
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “
Covered Party
”) becomes subject to a proceeding
under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing
such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such
interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, default rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such
default rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. 
228 
Section 9.17 
Credit Bidding
. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize
the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Secured Obligations pursuant
to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code of the United States, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure
or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid
and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to
contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in
allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid,
(i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the
Secured Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to
adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (provided that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity
interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of
the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in
Section
 10.01
 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Secured
Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without
the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Secured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of
another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Secured Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Secured Obligations shall
automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Secured Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Secured Obligations shall
automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the
acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests
in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

agreements shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document. 
Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, in connection with any determination as to whether the requisite Lenders have (A) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
departure by the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary therefrom, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to this Agreement or any 
234 
Loan Document or (C) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to, or under, this Agreement or any
Loan Document, any Lender (other than any Lender that is a (x) Regulated Bank Lender, (y) Revolving Credit Lender or (z) any Affiliate of the foregoing) that, as a result of its interest in any total return swap, total rate of return
swap, credit default swap or other derivative contract (other than any such total return swap, total rate of return swap, credit default swap or other derivative contract entered into pursuant to bona fide market making activities), has a net short
position with respect to any of the Loans or Commitments or with respect to any other tranche, class or series of Indebtedness for borrowed money incurred or issued by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries at such time of determination
(including commitments with respect to any revolving credit facility) (each such item of Indebtedness, including the Loan and Commitments, “
Specified Indebtedness
”) (each such Lender, a “
Net Short Lender
”) shall
have no right to vote with respect to any amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents and shall be deemed to have voted its interest as a Lender without discretion in the same proportion as the allocation of
voting with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Net Short Lenders (including in any plan of reorganization). For purposes of determining whether a Lender (alone or together with its Affiliates) has a “net short position” on any
date of determination: (i) derivative contracts with respect to any Specified Indebtedness and such contracts that are the functional equivalent thereof shall be counted at the notional amount of such contract in Dollars, (ii) notional
amounts in other currencies shall be converted to the Dollar equivalent thereof by such Lender in a commercially reasonable manner consistent with generally accepted financial practices and based on the prevailing conversion rate (determined on a 
mid-market
 basis) on the date of determination, (iii) derivative contracts in respect of an index that includes the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary or any instrument issued or guaranteed by the Parent
Borrower or any Subsidiary shall not be deemed to create a short position with respect to such Specified Indebtedness, so long as (x) such index is not created, designed, administered or requested by such Lender and (y) the Parent Borrower
and the Subsidiaries and any instrument issued or guaranteed by the Parent Borrower or the Subsidiaries, collectively, shall represent less than 5% of the components of such index, (iv) derivative transactions that are documented using either
the 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions or the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (collectively, the “
ISDA CDS Definitions
”) shall be deemed to create a short position with respect to the relevant Specified Indebtedness
if such Lender is a protection buyer or the equivalent thereof for such derivative transaction and (x) the relevant Specified Indebtedness is a “Reference Obligation” under the terms of such derivative transaction (whether specified
by name in the related documentation, included as a “Standard Reference Obligation” on the most recent list published by Markit, if “Standard Reference Obligation” is specified as applicable in the relevant documentation or
in any other manner), (y) the relevant Specified Indebtedness would be a “Deliverable Obligation” under the terms of such derivative transaction or (z) the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary is designated as a “Reference
Entity” under the terms of such derivative transaction and (v) credit derivative transactions or other derivatives transactions not documented using the ISDA CDS Definitions shall be deemed to create a short position with respect to any
Specified Indebtedness if such transactions offer the Lender protection against a decline in the value of such Specified Indebtedness, or in the credit quality of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary, in each case, other than as part of an index so
long as (x) such index is not created, designed, administered or requested by such Lender and (y) the Parent Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and any instrument issued or guaranteed by the Parent Borrower or the Subsidiaries, collectively,
shall represent less than 5% of the components of such index. In connection with any such amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, each Lender (other than any Lender that is a (x) Regulated Bank Lender,
(y) Revolving Credit Lender or (z) any Affiliate of the foregoing) will be deemed to have represented to the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it does not constitute a Net Short Lender, in each case, unless such Lender
shall have notified the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent prior to the requested response date with respect to such amendment, modification or waiver that it constitutes a Net Short Lender (it being understood and agreed that the Parent
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on each such representation and deemed representation). The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any
235 
duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Net Short Lenders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative
Agent shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or participant or prospective Lender or participant is a Net Short Lender or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of the voting in
any amendment or waiver to any Loan Document by any Net Short Lender. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of
determining compliance with the conditions specified in 
Section
 4.0
1
, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date, specifying its objection
thereto.

Administrative Agent, as applicable. This 
Section

that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, disbursements, fees or related expenses (A) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and

compliance occurs. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Loans or Commitments are assigned or participated (x) to
a Blocked Person or (y) without the Borrower’s consent to the extent such consent is otherwise required under 
Sections
 10.07(b)

such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with 
Section
 10.07
(d)
. 
(c)
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary
 agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register in which it shall record the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of the Loans, L/C Obligations
(specifying the Unreimbursed Amounts), L/C Borrowings and amounts due under 
Section
 2.03
, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (each such register maintained by the Administrative Agent, a
“
Register
”). The entries in the applicable Register shall be conclusive with respect to the applicable entries in such Register, absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in each Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information
regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as Defaulting Lender. The Registers shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, any Agent and any Lender (but only to entries with respect to itself), at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. This 
Section
 10.07(c)

Section
 2.11

maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related Treasury regulations (or any other relevant or successor provisions of the Code or of such Treasury regulations).
(d) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers,
sell participations to any Person (other than a Blocked Person; provided, however, that, participations may be sold to Disqualified Institutions unless a list of Disqualified Institutions has been made available to all applicable Lenders by or on
behalf of the Parent Borrower or Borrower Representative) (each, a “
Participant
”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the
Loans (including 
244 
such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); 
provided
 that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless otherwise agreed by the Borrowers; 
provided
 that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to 
Section
 10.01
 (in the case of any amendment, waiver or other modification
described in 
clause
 (a)
, 
(b)
, 
(c)
, 
(f)

Section
 10.07(e)
, the Parent Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of 
Sections 3.01
, 
3.04
 and 
3.05
 (subject to the requirements and the limitations of such Sections (it
being understood that the documentation required under 
Section
 3.01(g)
 shall be delivered solely to the participating Lender) and 
Section
 3.08
) to the same extent as if it were a Lender (but, with
respect to any particular Participant, to no greater extent than the Lender that sold the participation to such Participant) and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to 
Section
 10.07(b)
. To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of 
Section
 10.09
 as though it were a Lender (but, with respect to any particular Participant, to no greater extent than the Lender that sold the participation
to such Participant); 
provided
 such Participant agrees to be subject to 
Section
 2.13
 as though it were a Lender. 
(e) A Participant (i) agrees to be subject to the provisions of 
Sections 3.08
 as if it were an assignee pursuant to
Section
 10.07(b)
 and (ii) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under 
Section
 3.01
, 
3.04
 or 
3.05
 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive
with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation or the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Parent Borrower’s prior written consent. 
(f) Any Lender may at any time pledge
or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) (other than to a Disqualified Institution) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto. 
(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Lender (a “
Granting Lender
”)
may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative (an “
SPC
”) the option to provide all or any part of
any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; 
provided
 that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to do so, to make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is
required under 
Section
 2.12(b)(ii)
. Each party hereto hereby agrees that an SPC shall be entitled to the benefits of 
Sections 
3.01
, 
3.04
 and 
3.05
 (subject to the requirements and the limitations
of such Sections and 
Section
 3.08
); 
provided
 that neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the
Borrowers under this Agreement (including under 
Section
 3.01
, 
3.04
 or 
3.05
), unless the grant to such SPC is made with the Parent Borrower’s prior written consent. Each party hereto further agrees that
(i) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (ii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, 
245 
including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the Lender of record hereunder. Other than as expressly provided in this
Section
 10.07(g)
, (A) such Granting Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Granting Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (C) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Granting Lender in connection with such Granting Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. The
making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not, other than in respect of matters
unrelated to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the laws of
the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent and with the payment of a processing fee
of $3,500 or €3,500, as applicable, assign all or any portion of its rights hereunder with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) subject to 
Section
 10.08
, disclose on a confidential basis any 
non-public
 information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. 
(h) [Reserved]. 
(i)
[Reserved]. 
(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, any Lender may assign
all or any portion of its Term Loans, Specified Refinancing Term Loans and New Term Loans hereunder to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, but only if: 
(i) such assignment is made pursuant to a Dutch Auction open to all Term Lenders, Specified Refinancing Term Loan lenders or
New Term Loan lenders on a 
pro rata
 basis; 
(ii) [reserved]; 
(iii) any such Term Loans shall be automatically and permanently cancelled immediately upon acquisition thereof by the Parent
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; and 
(iv) the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries do not use the proceeds of the
Revolving Credit Facility (whether or not the Revolving Credit Facility has been increased pursuant to 
Section
 2.14
 or refinanced pursuant to 
Section
 2.18
) to acquire such Term Loan. 
In connection with any assignment pursuant to this 
Section
 10.07(j)
, each Lender acknowledges and agrees that, in
connection therewith, (1) the Parent Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries may have, and later may come into possession of, information regarding the Parent Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates not known
to such Lender and that may be material to a decision by such Lender to participate in such assignment (including material 
non-public
 information) (“
Excluded Information
”), (2) such Lender,
independently and, without reliance on the Parent Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, has made its own analysis and determination to participate in such assignment notwithstanding such Lender’s
lack of knowledge of the Excluded Information and (3) none of the Parent Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability to such Lender, and such Lender hereby waives and releases, to
the extent permitted by law, any claims such Lender may have against the Parent Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries, any Agent or any of their respective Affiliates, under applicable laws or otherwise, with respect to the nondisclosure of the Excluded
Information. 
246 
(k) [Reserved]. 
(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any L/C Issuer may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrowers and the Lenders, resign
as L/C Issuer; 
provided
 that on or prior to the expiration of such 
30-day
 period with respect to such resignation, the relevant L/C Issuer shall have identified a successor L/C Issuer willing to accept
its appointment as successor L/C Issuer, and the effectiveness of such resignation shall be conditioned upon such successor assuming the rights and duties of the L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer, Parent Borrower shall
be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders agreeing to accept such appointment a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; 
provided
, 
however
, that no failure by Parent Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the
L/C Issuer. If an L/C Issuer resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C
Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to 
Section
 2.03(d)
). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C
Issuer, (A) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer, and (B) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters
of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
(m) The applicable Lender, acting solely for this purpose as a 
non-fiduciary
 agent of the Borrowers
(solely for tax purposes), shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of (i) each SPC (other than any SPC that is treated as a disregarded entity of the Granting Lender for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that has
exercised its option pursuant to 
Section
 10.07(g)
 and (ii) each Participant, and the amount of each such SPC’s and Participant’s interest in such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this
Agreement or any Loan Document complying with the requirements of Sections 163(f), 871(h) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and the United States Treasury Regulations (the “
Participant Register
”); 
provided
 that no Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other
obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c)
 of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers and such Lender shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the applicable rights and/or obligations of such Lender under this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. 
(n) In the event that a transfer by any of the Secured Parties of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (and/or any relevant Loan
Document) occurred or was deemed to occur by way of novation, the Borrowers and any other Loan Parties explicitly agree that all securities and guarantees created under any Loan Documents shall be preserved for the benefit of the new Lender and the
other Secured Parties. 
Section 10.08

247 
contemplated hereby (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information

any audit or examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental bank regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority), to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, to promptly notify the Borrowers prior to such
disclosure); (c) in any legal, judicial, administrative proceeding or other compulsory process or otherwise as required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or similar legal process, in each case based upon the reasonable advice of the disclosing

any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions

Section
 10.08

any swap, hedge, or similar agreement or to any such contractual counterparty’s (or prospective contractual counterparty’s) professional advisor (other than a Disqualified Institution); or (l) in connection with establishing a
“due diligence” defense in connection with any legal, judicial, administrative proceeding or other process. In addition, the Agents and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to
market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the
Credit Extensions;

 that such Person is advised and agrees to be bound by the provisions of this 
Section
 10.08
. 
For the purposes of this 
Section
 10.08
, “
Information

Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof relating to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof or their respective businesses, other than any such information that is publicly available to any Agent or any Lender prior to disclosure by any Loan Party

Section
 10.08
 by such Lender or Agent. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this 
Section
 10.08
 shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for reasons of technical practicality, electronic communication may be sent in unencrypted form, even if the content may be subject to confidentiality and banking secrecy.

non-public

Information regarding suspected violations of laws, rules, or regulations to a Governmental Authority or self-regulatory authority without any notification to any Person. 
Section 10.09 
Setoff
. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, each Secured Party is authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, without prior notice to the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, any such
notice being waived by each Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in any currency),
other than deposits in fiduciary accounts as to which a Loan Party is acting as fiduciary for another Person who is not a Loan Party and other than payroll or trust fund accounts, at any time held by, and other Indebtedness (in any currency) at any

Security Agreement)), now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (or other Secured Agreement (as defined in the U.S. Security Agreement))

deposit or obligated on such Indebtedness; 
provided
 that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of

Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
Each Secured Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent after any such 
set-off
 and application made by such Secured Party; 
provided
, 
however
, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party under this 
Section
 10.09
 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent and such Secured Party may have.

”). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds
such unpaid principal, refunded to any Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 
Section 10.11 
Counterparts
.
This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery by telecopier or other electronic transmission of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this
Agreement 
249 
and such other Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier or other electronic transmission be confirmed by a 
manually-signed
 original thereof; 
provided
 that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier or other electronic
transmission. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Loan Document, any Assignment and Assumption, any Committed Loan Notice or any amendment or other modification hereof or
thereof (including waivers and consents) shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or
the use of a 
paper-based
 recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the
New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Any signature to any Loan Document, any Assignment and Assumption, any Committed Loan Notice or any amendment or
other modification hereof or thereof (including waivers and consents) may be delivered by facsimile, electronic mail (including .pdf) or any electronic signature complying with the U.S. Federal ESIGN Act of 2000 or the New York Electronic Signature
and Records Act or other transmission method (including, but not limited to, Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or other applicable law, 
e.g.
, www.docusign.com) and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to have been duly and validly
delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. 
Section 10.12
Integration; Effectiveness
. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and those provisions of the Fee Letter that, by their terms, survive the termination or expiration of the Fee Letter or the Closing Date, constitute the entire contract
among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. It is expressly agreed and confirmed by the parties hereto that the
provisions of the Fee Letter shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the occurrence of the Closing Date, and shall continue in effect thereafter in accordance with their terms. In the event of any conflict between the provisions
of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; 
provided
 that the inclusion of supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not
be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair meaning
thereof. Except as provided in 
Section
 4.01
, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto as of the Closing Date. 
Section 10.13 
Survival of
Representations and Warranties
. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and
delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or
any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation remains outstanding (other than contingent indemnification
obligations as to which no claim has been asserted and obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements, Secured Hedge Agreements, and Letters of Credit which have been, in each case, Cash Collateralized or as to which
arrangements satisfactory to the L/C Issuer that issued such Letters of Credit shall have been made).

Section 10.14 
Severability
. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.
The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this 
Section
 10.14
, if and to
the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

Section 10.19 
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
. In connection with all aspects of each transaction
contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), each Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and each of them acknowledges and agrees that it has informed its other
Affiliates, that: (i) (A) no fiduciary, advisory or agency relationship between any of the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries and any Agent, any Lender or any Arranger is intended to be or has been created in respect of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether any Agent, any Lender or any Arranger has advised or is advising the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries on other matters, (B) the arranging and other
services regarding this Agreement provided by the Agents, the Lenders and the Arrangers are 
arm’s-length

Lender nor any Arranger has any obligation to the Parent Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the
Agents, the Lenders and the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be 
252 
engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrowers and their respective Affiliates, and neither any Agent, any Lender nor any Arranger has any
obligation to disclose any of such interests and transactions to the Borrowers or their respective Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Agents, the
Arrangers, and the Lenders with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. 
Section 10.20 
Affiliate Activities

each Lender may be a full service securities firm engaged, either directly or through affiliates, in various activities, including securities trading, investment banking and financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging,

Section 10.21 
[Reserved]
. 
Section 10.22 
USA PATRIOT Act
. Each Lender that is subject to the PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on
behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 
107-56
 (signed into law October 26, 2001, as amended from time to
time)) (the “
PATRIOT Act
”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act. Each Loan Party shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other
information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and 
anti-money
 laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act and Beneficial Ownership Regulation. 
Section 10.23 
Judgment Currency
. If, for the
purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking
procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of any Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “
Judgment Currency
”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “
Agreement Currency
”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,
the Administrative 
253 
Agent may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum
originally due to the Administrative Agent from the applicable Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or the Person to whom such
obligation was owing against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to
the applicable Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable Law). 
Section 10.24 
Joint and
Several Liability
. 
(a) Each Borrower agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the other Borrowers
hereunder, including with respect to the payment of principal of and interest on all Loans, the payment of amounts owing in respect of Letters of Credit and the payment of fees and indemnities and reimbursement of costs and expenses. Each Borrower
is accepting joint and several liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and
indirectly, of each of the Borrowers and in consideration of the undertakings of each of the Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the obligations of each of them. Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally accepts, as a 
co-debtor,
 joint and several liability with each other Borrower, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of all of the Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them. If and to the extent that any of the Borrowers shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the
Obligations as and when due or to perform any of such Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event each other Borrower will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligations. A breach hereof or Default or
Event of Default hereunder as to any single Borrower shall constitute a breach, Default or Event of Default as to all the Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of the Loans made under
this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, or of any demand for any payment under this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders
under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement, except for any demands, notices and other
formalities expressly required under the terms of this Agreement. Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment
thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default (including any Default or Event of Default) by any Borrower in the
performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders in respect of any of the obligations hereunder,
and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of such obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or the Lenders, including any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to
pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this 
Section
 10.24
, afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving such Borrower, in
whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this 
Section
 10.24
, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of such Borrower under this
Section
 10.24
 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
any absorption, merger, amalgamation or any other change 
254 
whatsoever in the name, membership, constitution or place of formation of any Borrower. With respect to any Borrower’s Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of
the Borrowers hereunder with respect to Loans or other extensions of credit made to any of the other Borrowers hereunder, such Borrower waives, until the Obligations shall have been paid in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations as
to which no claim has been asserted and obligations and liabilities under Secured Cash Management Agreements, Secured Hedge Agreements or Letters of Credit which have been, in each case, Cash Collateralized or as to which arrangements satisfactory
to the L/C Issuer that issued such Letters of Credit shall have been made) and this Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce any right of subrogation or any remedy which an Agent and/or any Lender now has or may hereafter have
against any other Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of the Obligations, and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to an Agent and/or any Lender to secure payment of the Obligations
or any other liability of any Borrower to an Agent and/or any Lender. 
(b) Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent
that any Borrower shall be required to pay a portion of the Obligations which shall exceed the amount of Loans or other extensions of credit received by such Borrower and all interest, costs, fees and expenses attributable to such Loans or other
extensions of credit, then such Borrower shall be reimbursed by the other Borrowers for the amount of such excess. This clause is intended only to define the relative rights of Borrowers, and nothing set forth in this clause is intended or shall
impair the obligations of each Borrower, jointly and severally, to pay to Administrative Agent and Lenders the Obligations as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this clause or any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the liability incurred by each Borrower in respect of the Obligations of the other Borrowers (and any Lien granted by each
Borrower to secure such Obligations), not constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under the provisions of any applicable law of any state or other governmental unit (“
Fraudulent Conveyance
”). Consequently, each
Borrower, each Agent and each Lender hereby agree that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the incurrence of liability by any Borrower in respect of the Obligations of any other Borrower (or any Liens granted by such Borrower to
secure such Obligations) would, but for the application of this sentence, constitute a Fraudulent Conveyance, such liability (and such Liens) shall be valid and enforceable only to the maximum extent that would not cause the same to constitute a
Fraudulent Conveyance, and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall automatically be deemed to have been amended accordingly, 
nunc pro tunc
. 
(c) Each Borrower’s obligation to pay and perform the Obligations shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, as to any other
Borrower, (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement or any other Loan Document, in respect of any other Borrower, (iii) the application of any Loan proceeds to, or the extension of any other credit for
the benefit of, any other Borrower, any other Loan Party, or any of their Subsidiaries or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section
 10.24
, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, any Borrower’s obligations hereunder, in each case other than any payment in full of the Obligations (other than
contingent indemnification obligations not yet due or owing). Each of the Borrowers further agree that (i) its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if
at any time any payment of any such obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of, or the application of any Debtor Relief Laws to, any other Borrower, all as though such
payment had not been made and (ii) it hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke its joint and several liability under the Loan Documents and acknowledges that such liability is continuing in nature and applies to all
obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, whether existing now or in the future. 
255 
Section 10.25 
Acknowledgment and Consent to Bail
-In
 Action
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto, each party hereto acknowledges and accepts that any
liability of any party hereto to any other party hereto under or in connection with any Loan Document may be subject to Bail-In Action by the relevant Resolution Authority and acknowledges and accepts to be bound by: 
(a) the effect of any 
Bail-In
 Action in relation to any such liability, including: 
(1)
a reduction, in full or in part, in the principal amount, or outstanding amount due (including any accrued but
unpaid interest) in respect of any such liability; 
(2)
a conversion of all, or part of, any such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership that may be
issued to, or conferred on, it; and 
(3)
a cancellation of any such liability; and 
(b) a variation of any term of any Loan Document or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding between the parties hereto to the extent
necessary to give effect to any 
Bail-In
 Action in relation to any such liability. 
Section 10.26 
Parallel Liability
. 
(a) Each Loan Party irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Collateral Agent an amount equal to the aggregate amount of its
Corresponding Liabilities (as these may exist from time to time). 
(b) The Secured Parties and each Loan Party agree that: (i) each
Loan Party’s Parallel Liability is due and payable at the same time, in the same amount and in the same currency as its Corresponding Liabilities; (ii) each Loan Party’s Parallel Liability is decreased to the extent that its
Corresponding Liabilities have been irrevocably paid or discharged and its Corresponding Liabilities are decreased to the extent that its Parallel Liability has been irrevocably paid or discharged; (iii) each Loan Party’s Parallel
Liability is independent and separate from, and without prejudice to, its Corresponding Liabilities, and constitutes a single obligation of a Loan Party to the Collateral Agent (even though such Loan Party may owe more than one Corresponding
Liability to the Secured Parties under the Loan Documents) and an independent and separate claim of the Collateral Agent, to receive payment of that Parallel Liability (in its capacity as the independent and separate creditor of that Parallel
Liability and not as a cocreditor in respect of the Corresponding Liabilities); and (iv) for purposes under this 
Section
 10.26
, JPMorgan, in its capacity as Collateral Agent, acts in its own name and not as agent,
representative or trustee of the Secured Parties and accordingly holds neither its claim resulting from a Parallel Liability nor any securing a Parallel Liability on trust. As used herein, “
Parallel Liability
” means a Loan
Party’s undertaking pursuant to this 
Section
 10.26
. 
Section 10.27 
Waiver of Sovereign
Immunity
. 
Each Loan Party that is incorporated outside the United States, in respect of itself, its Subsidiaries, its process agents,
and its properties and revenues, hereby irrevocably agrees that, to the extent that such Loan Party or its respective Subsidiaries or any of its or its respective Subsidiaries’ properties has or may hereafter acquire any right of immunity,
whether characterized as sovereign immunity or otherwise, from 
256 
any legal proceedings, whether in the United States or elsewhere, to enforce or collect upon the Loans or any Loan Document or any other liability or obligation of such Loan Party or any of their
respective Subsidiaries related to or arising from the transactions contemplated by any of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, immunity from suit, immunity from service of process, immunity from jurisdiction or judgment of any court
or tribunal, immunity from execution of a judgment, and immunity of any of its property from attachment prior to any entry of judgment, or from attachment in aid of execution upon a judgment, such Loan Party, for itself and on behalf of its
Subsidiaries, hereby expressly waives, to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, any such immunity, and agrees not to assert any such right or claim in any such proceeding, whether in the United States or elsewhere. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Party further agrees that the waivers set forth in this 
Section
 10.27
 shall have the fullest extent permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 of the United
States and are intended to be irrevocable for purposes of such Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. 
Section 10.28 
Lender Affiliates
and Facility Office
. 
(a) In respect of any Revolving Credit Loans or Letters of Credit to a particular Borrower (“
Designated
Loans
”) a Revolving Credit Lender (a “
Designating Lender
”) may at any time and from time to time designate (by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower): 
(i) a substitute Lending Office from which it will make Designated Loans (a “
Substitute Lending Office
”); or
(ii) nominate an Affiliate to act as the Lender of Designated Loans (a “
Substitute Affiliate Lender
”).
(b) A notice to nominate a Substitute Affiliate Lender must be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower and be
countersigned by the relevant Substitute Affiliate Lender confirming it will be bound as a Lender under this Agreement in respect of the Designated Loans in respect of which it acts as Lender. 
(c) The Designating Lender will act as the representative of any Substitute Affiliate Lender it nominates for all administrative purposes
under this Agreement. The Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties will be entitled to deal only with the Designating Lender, except that payments will be made in respect of Designated Loans to the
Lending Office of the Substitute Affiliate Lender. In particular the Commitments of the Designating Lender will not be treated as reduced by the introduction of the Substitute Affiliate Lender for voting purposes under this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.
(d) Save as mentioned in 
clause (c)
 above, a Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as a Lender for
all purposes under the Loan Documents and having a Revolving Credit Commitment equal to the principal amount of all Designated Loans in which it is participating if and for so long as it continues to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender under this
Agreement.
(e) A Designating Lender may revoke its designation of an Affiliate as a Substitute Affiliate Lender by notice in writing to
the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower; 
provided
 that such notice may only take effect when there are no Designated Loans outstanding to the Substitute Affiliate Lender. Upon such Substitute Affiliate Lender ceasing to be a
Substitute Affiliate Lender the Designating Lender will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any party) all rights and obligations previously vested in the Substitute Affiliate Lender. 
257 
(f) If a Designating Lender designates a Substitute Lending Office or Substitute Affiliate
Lender in accordance with this clause: 
(i) any Substitute Affiliate Lender shall be treated for the purposes of
Section
 3.01
 as having become a Lender on the Closing Date; and 
(ii) the provisions of
Section
 10.07(e)
 shall not apply to or in respect of any Substitute Lending Office or Substitute Affiliate Lender. 
Section 10.29 
Acknowledgement of the Lenders and L/C Issuers
. The Lenders and L/C Issuers
acknowledge that there may be a constant flow of information (including information which may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Loan Parties) between the Loan Parties and their

Exhibit 99.1 
MKS Announces Closing of Private Offering of €1 Billion of 4.250% Senior Notes and Refinancing of
Term Loan Facility 
ANDOVER, MA, February
 4, 2026 – 
MKS Inc. (NASDAQ: MKSI) (“MKS”) today announced the
closing of its private offering (the “offering”) of €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.250% senior notes due 2034 (the “notes”). 
In addition, MKS announced that it has completed the previously announced refinancing of its existing $2.2 billion U.S. dollar tranche B term loan,
€587 million euro tranche B term loan and $675 million revolving credit facility with a new $914 million U.S. dollar tranche B term loan, €587 million euro tranche B term loan and $1.0 billion revolving credit
facility. The refinancing resulted in (i) an extension of the maturity of the above-described term loan facility to 2033 and the revolving credit facility to 2031 and (ii) a reduction of the interest rate for (a) the U.S. dollar
tranche B term loan from SOFR plus a margin of 200 basis points to SOFR plus 175 basis points, (b) the euro tranche B term loan from EURIBOR plus a margin of 250 basis points to EURIBOR plus 200 basis points and (c) the revolving credit
facility from SOFR plus a margin of 250 basis points to SOFR plus 175 basis points. The refinancing also eliminated the credit spread adjustment applicable to SOFR borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which previously added 10 basis
points, 15 basis points, and 25 basis points to 
one-month,
 three-month and 
six-month
 interest periods, respectively. 
MKS used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to prepay approximately $1.3 billion of its U.S. dollar tranche B term loan.
The combined actions described above diversify MKS’ capital structure, replace a portion of its secured debt with unsecured debt, extend its debt
maturities and reduce its interest expense. Based on current interest rates, MKS expects that the annualized cash interest savings from the combined actions will be approximately $27 million. 
The notes were offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”) and to 
non-U.S.
 persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes have not been and will not be
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. 
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of
an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, any securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
