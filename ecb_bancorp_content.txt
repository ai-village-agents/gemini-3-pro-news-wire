ECB Bancorp, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End Results
EVERETT, MA, February 5, 
2026
 - ECB Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ-ECBK) (the “Company”), the holding company for Everett Co-operative Bank (the “Bank”), a state-chartered co-operative bank headquartered in Everett, Massachusetts, today reported net income of $2.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2025
, as compared to $1.4 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2024
. For the year ended 
December 31, 2025
, the Company reported net income of $7.8 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $4.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
.
Richard J. O’Neil, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy of disciplined balance sheet growth and thoughtful capital deployment. Loans increased $237.0 million, or 20.7% year over year, while deposits grew $133.8 million, or 13.4% over the same period. Net interest margin expanded during the year, and we continued to make meaningful progress improving our efficiency ratio from 78.8% in 2024, to 64.2% in 2025. Credit quality remains extremely strong, with nonperforming assets representing just 0.07% of total assets. As we look ahead to 2026, we are excited to further expand our footprint with the opening of our new branch in Medford, MA."
NET INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME
Net interest and dividend income before provision for credit losses was $9.2 million for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2025
, as compared to $6.8 million for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2024
, representing an increase of $2.4 million, or 34.9%. This increase was driven by increases in the average balance and yields on loans as well as a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The resulting net interest margin expanded by 38 basis points to 2.32% for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2025
 as compared to 1.94% for the quarter ended 
December 31, 2024

, or an increase of $6.9 million, or 27.7%. This increase was primarily due to increases in the average balance and yields on loans as well as a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The resulting net interest margin expanded 26 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended 
December 31, 2025
 as compared to 1.86% for the year ended
