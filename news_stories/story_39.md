**XTI Aerospace (XTIA) Sells Inpixon Business; Das Resigns from Board**

XTI Aerospace, Inc. (Nasdaq: XTIA) has executed a significant restructuring move, divesting its "Inpixon Business" (indoor positioning/RTLS) to a German entity, EVO 467. GmbH, for €4.64 million (~.48 million).

**Key Developments:**
*   **Divestiture:** The sale includes Inpixon GmbH, Aware RTLS, Inc., and IntraNav GmbH. The purchase price is deferred, bearing 5% interest, with a unique "Unwind Option" exercisable by XTIA for 15 months.
*   **Executive Departure:** In connection with the sale, Soumya Das has resigned from the Board and as CEO of the RTLS division.
*   **Severance Package:** Das will receive ~20,000 in total cash payments (salary, bonus, vacation) plus COBRA benefits.

This move appears to streamline XTI Aerospace's focus by shedding the legacy Inpixon assets.
