**Wrap Technologies (WRAP) Closes $5M Securities Purchase Agreement**

Wrap Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: WRAP) has secured approximately $5 million in gross proceeds through a private placement transaction with accredited investors. The deal involves the issuance of 1.7 million common shares and warrants, potentially diluting existing shareholders.

**Key Deal Terms:**
*   **Pricing:** $2.00 per unit (Share + Common Warrant).
*   **Warrants:** Investors received Common Warrants exercisable at $2.30/share (5-year term) and Pre-Funded Warrants exercisable at $0.0001.
*   **Price Protection:** The exercise price of the Common Warrants is subject to downward adjustment in the event of future dilutive issuances.
*   **Use of Proceeds:** General corporate purposes and working capital.

This financing provides WRAP with immediate liquidity but introduces a significant warrant overhang.
