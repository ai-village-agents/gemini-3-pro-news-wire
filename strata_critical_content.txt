Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
The Credit Agreement
On January 30, 2026 (the “Closing Date”),
Strata Critical Medical, Inc. (the “Company”), Strata Critical, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company (“Critical”), Trinity Air Medical, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of
Critical (“Trinity Air”), Keystone Perfusion Services, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary
of Critical (“Keystone”; together with Trinity Air and any other person that becomes party thereto as a Borrower, collectively,
the “Borrowers”), entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Borrowers, the Company and
Critical, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), the other Loan Parties thereto,
and the Lenders thereto. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Current Report on Form 8-K (this “Current
Report”) shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement. The Borrowers, the Company and Critical are referred
to collectively as the “Loan Parties.”
The Credit Agreement provides for secured, asset-based
revolving credit loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0 million (the “ABL Facility”). Subject to the conditions
set forth in the Credit Agreement, the ABL Facility may be increased by up to an aggregate of $20.0 million. Under the Credit Agreement,
the ABL Facility is guaranteed by the Company and Critical and is secured by perfected, first priority liens on personal property of the
Loan Parties pursuant to the Pledge and Security Agreement, dated January 30, 2026 (the “Security Agreement”), executed
by the Loan Parties for the benefit of the secured parties under the Credit Agreement and other Loan Documents, which is discussed in
more detail below.
The ABL Facility will mature on January 30,
2029 (the “Maturity Date”). Interest shall accrue at one of the following rates to be selected by Trinity (as the Borrower
Representative), in its discretion: (i) a fixed rate of interest based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (for interest periods of 1,
3 or 6 months) plus a 2.00% margin; or (ii) a floating rate of interest based on the Term SOFR Reference Rate for a one-month period,
as adjusted on the first Business Day of each month plus a 2.00% margin. The Borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee which will
accrue at 0.25% per annum on the unused portion of the ABL Facility and be payable on the first Business Day of each calendar month. Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers may also request the issuance of Letters of Credit pursuant to the
ABL Facility. Letters of Credit issued under the ABL Facility accrue customary fees and generally must expire no later than five Business
Days prior to the Maturity Date.
The ABL Facility will be used for working capital
and for other general organizational purposes.
The Credit Agreement includes customary representations
and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default for credit agreements of its type and size. Affirmative covenants
include, without limitation, requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain their legal existence and governmental approvals,
delivery of certain financial reports, and compliance with laws and regulations. Negative covenants include, without limitation, restrictions
on indebtedness, liens, mergers and other fundamental changes, investments and guarantees, asset sales and sale-leasebacks, speculative
derivatives, restricted payments (including dividends and share purchases), and certain debt prepayments, and affiliate transactions,
in each case subject to customary exceptions and baskets. The financial covenant under the Credit Agreement includes a springing minimum
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.05 to 1.00 for the trailing twelve month period then ending, which covenant is in effect when the Borrowers’
availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) $5,000,000 and (b) 20% of the aggregate commitments of the
lenders.
The events of default include, without limitation,
payment defaults, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants, cross default to material
indebtedness, certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, unsatisfied judgments over a threshold, certain ERISA-related events, violations
of certain laws and regulations, and a change of control of the Company. Under the Credit Agreement, upon an event of default, the lenders
may, among other rights, terminate their lending commitments, accelerate the Company’s obligations, require cash collateralization
of letter of credit exposure, and exercise certain remedies with respect to the Collateral.
The Security Agreement
On the Closing Date, the Loan Parties (collectively
with any additional entities that may become parties thereto, the “Grantors”) entered into the Security Agreement with the
Administrative Agent. The Security Agreement establishes a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and assets
of the Grantors and secures the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Grantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement,
the Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In connection with the execution of the Security Agreement, the Grantors also executed
other ancillary loan documents customary for transactions of this type.
The descriptions of the Credit Agreement and the
Security Agreement in this Current Report are summaries, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference
to the complete text of each agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report, respectively, and are incorporated
herein by reference. The representations and warranties of the Company and its subsidiaries in the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement
were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of their specific dates and were solely for the benefit of the lenders party thereto.
The Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement are contractual documents that establish and govern the legal relations among the parties
thereto and are not intended to be a source of factual, business, or operational information about the Company and its subsidiaries. The
representations and warranties made by the Company and its subsidiaries in the Credit Agreement and the Security Agreement may be subject
to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Accordingly, investors
and security holders should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts or circumstances.

At
the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral
multiple of $250,000 and not less than $500,000; provided that an CBFR Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire

provided
 that, each such electronic Borrowing Request submitted through the Approved Borrower Portal,
if permitted, is not required to be signed but shall be submitted by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative or its duly

in
the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by

the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall the Borrowers be permitted to request pursuant to this Section 2.03, prior to a Benchmark Transition Event and
Benchmark Replacement Date with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, an RFR Loan (it being understood and agreed that Daily Simple SOFR shall
only apply to the extent provided in Sections 2.14(a) and 2.14(f), as applicable).

Section 2.04.       
Protective
Advances
. (a)  Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Administrative Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders,
from time to time in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion (but shall have absolutely no obligation to), to make Loans to the
Borrowers, on behalf of all Lenders, which the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (i) to
preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (ii) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment
of the Loans and other Obligations, or (iii) to pay any other amount chargeable to or required to be paid by the Borrowers pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, including payments of reimbursable expenses (including costs, fees, and expenses as described in Section 9.03)
and other sums payable under the Loan Documents (any of such Loans are herein referred to as “
Protective Advances
”);
provided
 that, the aggregate amount of Protective Advances outstanding at any time shall not exceed the greater of (x) $3,000,000
and (y) 10% of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments; 
provided further
 that, the Aggregate Revolving Exposure after giving effect
to the Protective Advances being made shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitment. Protective Advances may be made even if the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have not been satisfied. The Protective Advances shall be secured by the Liens in
favor of the Administrative Agent in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Obligations hereunder. All Protective Advances shall be
CBFR Borrowings. The making of a Protective Advance on any one occasion shall not obligate the Administrative Agent to make any Protective
Advance on any other occasion. The Administrative Agent’s authorization to make Protective Advances may be revoked at any time by
100% of the Lenders (other than any Defaulting Lender). Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively
upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt thereof. At any time that there is sufficient Availability and the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 4.02 have been satisfied, the Administrative Agent may request the Revolving Lenders to make a Revolving Loan
to repay a Protective Advance. At any other time the Administrative Agent may require the Lenders to fund their risk participations described
in Section 2.04(b).
(b)            
Upon
the making of a Protective Advance by the Administrative Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default), each Lender shall
be deemed, without further action by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Administrative Agent,
without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Protective Advance in proportion to its Applicable Percentage.
From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender is required to fund its participation in any Protective Advance purchased hereunder,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of all payments of principal
and interest and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent in respect of such Protective Advance.
Section 2.05.       
Swingline
Loans and Overadvances
.
(a)            
The
Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Revolving Lenders agree that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, promptly after the Borrower Representative requests a CBFR Borrowing, the Swingline Lender may elect to
have the terms of this Section 2.05(a) apply to such Borrowing Request by advancing, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders and
in the amount requested, same day funds to the Borrowers, on the date of the applicable Borrowing to the Funding Account (each such Loan
made solely by the Swingline Lender pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) is referred to in this Agreement as a “
Swingline
Loan
”), with settlement among them as to the Swingline Loans to take place on a periodic basis as set forth in Section 2.05(d).
Each Swingline Loan shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to other CBFR Loans funded by the Revolving Lenders, except
that all payments thereon shall be payable to the Swingline Lender solely for its own account. In addition, the Borrowers hereby authorize
the Swingline Lender to, and the Swingline Lender may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein (but without any further written
notice required), not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Business Day, make available to the Borrowers by means of a credit
to the Funding Account or the Controlled Disbursement Account, the proceeds of a Swingline Loan to the extent necessary to pay items to
be drawn on any Controlled Disbursement Account that Business Day subject to the Administrative Agent’s standard procedures for
calculating clearing totals each morning; 
provided
 that, if on any Business Day there is insufficient borrowing capacity to permit
the Swingline Lender to make available to the Borrowers a Swingline Loan in the amount necessary to pay all items to be so drawn on any
such Controlled Disbursement Account on such Business Day, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested a CBFR Borrowing pursuant
to Section 2.03 in the amount of such deficiency to be made on such Business Day. The aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding
at any time shall not exceed $0 (the “
Swingline Sublimit
”). The Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan
if the requested Swingline Loan exceeds Availability (before or after giving effect to such Swingline Loan). All Swingline Loans
shall be CBFR Borrowings.
50
(b)            
Any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at the request of the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent may
in its sole discretion (but with absolutely no obligation), on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, (x) make Revolving Loans to the Borrowers
in amounts that exceed Availability (any such excess Revolving Loans are herein referred to collectively as “
Overadvances
”)
or (y) deem the amount of Revolving Loans outstanding to the Borrowers that are in excess of Availability to be Overadvances; 
provided
that, no Overadvance shall result in a Default due to Borrowers’ failure to comply with Section 2.01 for so long as such Overadvance
remains outstanding in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, but solely with respect to the amount of such Overadvance. In addition,
Overadvances may be made even if the condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02(c) has not been satisfied. All Overadvances
shall constitute CBFR Borrowings. The making of an Overadvance on any one occasion shall not obligate the Administrative Agent to make
any Overadvance on any other occasion. The authority of the Administrative Agent to make Overadvances is limited to an aggregate amount
not to exceed 10% of the Revolving Credit Commitments at any time and no Overadvance shall cause any Revolving Lender’s Revolving
Exposure to exceed its Revolving Commitment; 
provided
 that, the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Administrative Agent’s
authorization to make Overadvances. Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Administrative
Agent’s receipt thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 2.11),
the Borrowers may prepay any Overadvance in whole or in part at any time and in any amount; provided that (i) no Overadvance may
remain outstanding for more than thirty days and (ii) each Overadvance shall be due and payable in full at the time set forth in
Section 2.10.
(c)            
Upon
the making of a Swingline Loan or an Overadvance (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default and regardless of whether a Settlement
has been requested with respect to such Swingline Loan or Overadvance), each Revolving Lender shall be deemed, without further action
by any party hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from the Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case
may be, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Swingline Loan or Overadvance in proportion to its
Applicable Percentage of the Revolving Commitment. The Swingline Lender or the Administrative Agent may, at any time, require the Revolving
Lenders to fund their participations. From and after the date, if any, on which any Revolving Lender is required to fund its participation
in any Swingline Loan or Overadvance purchased hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender, such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent in
respect of such Swingline Loan or Overadvance.
51
(d)            
The
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Swingline Lender, shall request settlement (a “
Settlement
”) with the Revolving
Lenders on at least a weekly basis or on any date that the Administrative Agent elects, by notifying the Revolving Lenders of such requested
Settlement by facsimile, telephone, or e-mail no later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the date of such requested Settlement
(the “
Settlement Date
”). Each Revolving Lender (other than the Swingline Lender, in the case of the Swingline Loans)
shall transfer the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the applicable
Loan with respect to which Settlement is requested to the Administrative Agent, to such account of the Administrative Agent as the Administrative
Agent may designate, not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Settlement Date. Settlements may occur during the existence
of a Default and whether or not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 have then been satisfied. Such amounts
transferred to the Administrative Agent shall be applied against the amounts of the Swingline Lender’s Swingline Loans and, together
with Swingline Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Revolving Lenders,
respectively. If any such amount is not transferred to the Administrative Agent by any Revolving Lender on such Settlement Date, the Swingline
Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, as specified in Section 2.07.
Section 2.06.       
Letters
of Credit
. (a)
General
. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower Representative may request any Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit for its own account or for the account
of another Borrower denominated in dollars as the applicant thereof for the support of its or its Subsidiaries’ obligations, in
a form reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period; 
provided
that no Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue a Letter of Credit that would result in more than a total of 20 Letters of
Credit outstanding.
52
(b)            
Notice
of Issuance, Amendment, Extension; Certain Conditions
. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment or extension
of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower Representative shall deliver by hand or facsimile (or transmit through Electronic System,
the Approved Borrower Portal, or other electronic communication, in each case to the extent arrangements for doing so have been approved
by the respective Issuing Bank) to an Issuing Bank selected by it and to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of, but in any
event no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of issuance, amendment or extension) a written notice requesting
the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such
other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend or extend such Letter of Credit. In addition, as a condition to any such Letter
of Credit issuance, the applicable Borrower shall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the
issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the respective Issuing
Bank and using such Issuing Bank’s standard form (each, a “
Letter of Credit Agreement
”). In the event of any
conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall control. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment
or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrowers shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed $5,000,000, (ii) the aggregate Standby LC Exposure shall
not exceed $5,000,000, (iii) the aggregate Commercial LC Exposure shall not exceed $5,000,000, (iv) no Revolving Lender’s
Revolving Exposure shall exceed its Revolving Commitment and (v) the Aggregate Revolving Exposure shall not exceed the lesser of
(x) the Aggregate Revolving Commitment and (y) the Borrowing Base. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
contained herein, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue or modify any Letter of Credit if, immediately after giving effect thereto,
the outstanding LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit issued by such Person and its Affiliates would exceed such Issuing Bank’s
Issuing Bank Sublimit. Without limiting the foregoing and without affecting the limitations contained herein, it is understood and agreed
that the Borrower Representative may from time to time request that an Issuing Bank issue Letters of Credit in excess of its individual
Issuing Bank Sublimit in effect at the time of such request, and each Issuing Bank agrees to consider any such request in good faith.
Any Letter of Credit so issued by an Issuing Bank in excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit then in effect shall nonetheless constitute
a Letter of Credit for all purposes of this Agreement, and shall not affect the Issuing Bank Sublimit of any other Issuing Bank, subject
to the limitations on the aggregate LC Exposure set forth in clause (i) of this Section 2.06(b).
An Issuing Bank shall not
be under any obligation to issue, amend or extend any Letter of Credit if:
(i)            
any
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank
from issuing, amending or extending such Letter of Credit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from issuing, amending or extending
such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law relating to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit the issuance, amendment or extension
of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, or any such order, judgment or decree, or law shall impose upon
such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital or liquidity requirement (for which such Issuing
Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed
loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Effective Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it, or
(ii)            
the
issuance, amendment or extension of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters
of credit generally.
53
(c)            
Expiration
Date
. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination or non-renewal by notice from the applicable Issuing Bank to
the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance
of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, including, without limitation, any automatic
renewal provision, one year after such extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.
(d)            
Participations
.
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the term thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby grants to each
Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to
such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration
and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the respective Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing
Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrowers on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason, including after the Maturity Date. Each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit and to make payments in respect of such acquired participations
is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment or extension of any Letter
of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments.
(e)            
Reimbursement
.
If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on (i) the
Business Day that the Borrower Representative receives notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower Representative
receives such notice, if such notice is received after 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on the day of receipt; 
provided
 that
the Borrowers may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that
such payment be financed with a CBFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the
Borrowers’ obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting CBFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline
Loan, as applicable. If the Borrowers fail to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender
of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrowers in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage
of the payment then due from the Borrowers, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.07 shall apply, 
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the respective Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt
by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payment to the respective Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse
such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant
to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of CBFR Revolving Loans or a Swingline
Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
54
(f)            
Obligations
Absolute
. The Borrowers’ joint and several obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of
this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being
untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by the respective Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation
of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or
equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers’ obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent,
the Revolving Lenders, nor any Issuing Bank or any of their respective Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason
of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective
of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission
or delivery of any draft, document, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required
to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the respective Issuing Bank; 
provided
 that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an Issuing
Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages,
claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Borrower that
are caused by such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a
Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed
to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties
agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents
if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
55
(g)            
Disbursement
Procedures
. The Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the specific terms of the
Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of
Credit. Such Issuing Bank shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by fax or through Electronic System) of such demand for payment if such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement
thereunder; 
provided
 that such notice need not be given prior to payment by the Issuing Bank and any failure to give or delay in
giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect
to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)            
Interim
Interest
. If the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrowers shall reimburse
such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from
and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrowers reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the
rate per annum then applicable to CBFR Revolving Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement
is payable; 
provided
 that, if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such
Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of
this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank for such LC Disbursement shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.
(i)            
Replacement
and Resignation of an Issuing Bank
.
(i)            
An
Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent, the replaced
Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of an
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account
of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (A) the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit
to be issued by it thereafter and (B) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor
or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement
of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement,
but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit.
(ii)            
Subject
to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty
days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower Representative and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning
Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.06(i)(i) above.
56
(j)            
Cash
Collateralization
. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower Representative receives
notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders
with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the aggregate LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this
paragraph, the Borrowers shall deposit in an account or accounts with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent
and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the “
LC Collateral Account
”), an amount in cash equal to 105% of the
amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon; 
provided
 that the obligation to deposit such
cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other
notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to any Borrower described in 
Sections 7.01(h)
 or
(i)
. Such Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent required by Sections
2.10(b), 2.11(b) or 2.20. Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance
of the Secured Obligations. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or paragraph (c) of this Section, if any LC Exposure
remains outstanding after the expiration date specified in said paragraph (c), the Borrowers shall immediately deposit in the LC Collateral
Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of such LC Exposure as of such date 
plus
 any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Administrative
Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the LC Collateral Account and the Borrowers
hereby grant the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account and all money or other assets on deposit therein
or credited thereto. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers’ risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest
or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the LC Collateral Account. Moneys in the LC Collateral Account shall be applied
by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related
fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the
consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the aggregate LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
Secured Obligations. If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers within three (3) Business
Days after all such Event of Default have been cured or waived as confirmed in writing by the Administrative Agent.
(k)            
Issuing
Bank Reports to the Administrative Agent
. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall, in addition
to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) periodic activity
(for such period or recurrent periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank, including all issuances, extensions, and amendments, all expirations and cancelations and all disbursements and reimbursements,
(ii) reasonably prior to the time that such Issuing Bank issues, amends or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance,
amendment or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued, amended or extended by it and outstanding after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day
on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iv) on any Business Day on which
any Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure
and the amount of such LC Disbursement, and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.
57
(l)            
Letters
of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries
. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any
obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the “account party,” “applicant,”
“customer,” “instructing party,” or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any
rights of the Issuing Bank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter
of Credit, the Borrowers (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including
to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of a Borrower and (ii) irrevocably
waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such
Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its
Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrowers, and that each Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses
of such Subsidiaries.
Section 2.07.       
Funding
of Borrowings
. (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by such Lender hereunder on the proposed date thereof solely
by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage; 
provided
that, Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower
Representative by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of the Administrative Agent to the Funding Account;
provided
 that CBFR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of (i) an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall
be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank and (ii) a Protective Advance or an Overadvance shall be retained
by the Administrative Agent.
(b)            
Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers each severally agree
to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable to CBFR
Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included
in such Borrowing, 
provided
, that any interest received from a Borrower by the Administrative Agent during the period beginning
when Administrative Agent funded the Borrowing until such Lender pays such amount shall be solely for the account of the Administrative
Agent (it being understood that none of the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay to such Lender any interest with respect to the period
for which such Borrower paid interest to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement).
58
Section 2.08.       
Interest
Elections
. (a)  Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case
of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower
Representative may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Term Benchmark
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower Representative may elect different options
with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This
Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, Overadvances or Protective Advances, which may not be converted or continued.(b)
To
make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower Representative shall submit an Interest Election Request to the Administrative
Agent through Electronic System or the Approved Borrower Portal, in each case to the extent arrangements for doing so have been approved
by the Administrative Agent, by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrowers were requesting
a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request
shall be irrevocable and shall be signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative; 
provided
 that, each such electronic
Interest Election Request submitted through the Approved Borrower Portal, if permitted, is not required to be signed but shall be submitted
by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower Representative or its duly appointed designee to the Administrative Agent.
(c)            
Each
Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)            
the
name of the applicable Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being
elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)            
the
effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)            
whether
the resulting Borrowing is to be a CBFR Borrowing or a Term Benchmark Borrowing; and
59
(iv)            
if
the resulting Borrowing is a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election,
which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests
a Term Benchmark Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrowers shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period
of one month’s duration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Borrowers be permitted to request pursuant to this
Section 2.08(c), prior to a Benchmark Transition Event and Benchmark Replacement Date with respect to the Term SOFR Rate, an RFR
Loan (it being understood and agreed that Daily Simple SOFR shall only apply to the extent provided in Section 2.14(a) and 2.14(f),
as applicable).
(d)            
Promptly
following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)            
If
the Borrower Representative fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Term Benchmark Borrowing prior to the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period
such Borrowing shall be converted to a CBFR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower Representative, then,
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Term Benchmark Borrowing
or an RFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, (A) each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall be converted to a CBFR Borrowing at the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (B) each RFR Borrowing shall be converted to a CBFR Borrowing on the next Interest
Payment Date.
Section 2.09.       
Termination
of Commitment; Increase in Revolving Commitments
.
(a)            
Unless
previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
(b)            
The
Borrowers may at any time, without premium or penalty (other than as provided in Section 2.16), terminate the Revolving Commitments

(c)            
[Reserved.]
(d)            
The
Borrower Representative shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (b) of
this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination, specifying such election and
the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower Representative pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; 
provided
 that
a notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower Representative may state that such notice is conditioned
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower Representative (by notice
to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination of the Revolving
Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Revolving Commitments.
60
(e)            
The
Borrowers may request an increase the Revolving Commitments by obtaining additional Revolving Commitments, either from one or more of
the Lenders or another lending institution; 
provided
 that (i) any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount
of $5,000,000, (ii) the Borrower Representative, on behalf of the Borrowers, may make a maximum of four (4) such requests, (iii) after
giving effect thereto, the sum of the total of the additional Revolving Commitments does not exceed $20,000,000, (iv) each existing
Lender shall have been offered the right to provide all or a portion of such increase before such offer is made to new Lenders, (v) if
after ten (10) Business Days after such offer to existing Lenders such existing Lenders have not agreed to provide all or any portion
of such increase, then the Borrowers may seek Revolving Commitments from new Lenders for the balance of such Commitments not provided
by existing Lenders so long the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank have approved the identity of any such new Lender, such approvals
not to be unreasonably withheld, (vi) the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Bank have approved the identity of any such new Lender,
such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld, (vii) any such new Lender assumes all of the rights and obligations of a “Lender”
hereunder, and (viii) the procedures described in Section 2.09(f) have been satisfied. Nothing contained in this Section 2.09
shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder at any time.
(f)            
Any
amendment hereto for such an increase or addition shall be in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and shall only
require the written signatures of the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and each Lender being added or increasing its Commitment, subject
only to the approval of all Lenders if any such increase or addition would cause the Revolving Commitments to exceed $50,000,000. As a
condition precedent to such an increase or addition, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a certificate of
each Loan Party signed by an authorized officer of such Loan Party (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan
Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (B) in the case of the Borrowers, certifying that, before and after giving effect
to such increase or addition, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Article III and the other Loan Documents are
true and correct, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they
are true and correct as of such earlier date, (2) no Default exists and (3) the Borrowers are in compliance (on a pro forma
basis) with the covenants contained in Section 6.12 and (ii) legal opinions and documents consistent with those delivered on
the Effective Date, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent.
(g)            
On
the effective date of any such increase or addition, (i) any Lender increasing (or, in the case of any newly added Lender, extending)
its Revolving Commitment shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative
Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase
or addition and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender’s portion of the outstanding Revolving
Loans of all the Lenders to equal its revised Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and the Administrative Agent
shall make such other adjustments among the Lenders with respect to the Revolving Loans then outstanding and amounts of principal, interest,
commitment fees and other amounts paid or payable with respect thereto as shall be necessary, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent,
in order to effect such reallocation and (ii)  the Borrowers shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving
Loans as of the date of any increase (or addition) in the Revolving Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving
Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower Representative, in accordance with
the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Term Benchmark Loan, shall be subject
to indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last
day of the related Interest Periods. Within a reasonable time after the effective date of any increase or addition, the Administrative
Agent shall, and is hereby authorized and directed to, revise the Commitment Schedule to reflect such increase or addition and shall distribute
such revised Commitment Schedule to each of the Lenders and the Borrower Representative, whereupon such revised Commitment Schedule shall
replace the old Commitment Schedule and become part of this Agreement.

Repayment
of Loans; Evidence of Debt

each Protective Advance on the earlier of the Maturity Date and demand by the Administrative Agent and (iii) to the Administrative
Agent the then unpaid principal amount of each Overadvance on the earlier of the Maturity Date and demand by the Administrative Agent.
(b)            
At
all times during any Cash Dominion Period (but without any further written notice required to any Borrower), on each Business Day, the
Administrative Agent shall apply all funds credited to the Collection Account on the immediately preceding Business Day (at the discretion
of the Administrative Agent, whether or not immediately available) 
first
 to prepay any Protective Advances and Overadvances that
may be outstanding, pro rata, and 
second
 to prepay the Revolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) and, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure to the extent required by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent any funds credited to the Collection Account constitute Net Proceeds, the application of such Net Proceeds
shall be subject to Section 2.11(c).
(c)            
Each
Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the Borrowers to such
Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from
time to time hereunder.

The
Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and
Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become

hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
62
(e)            
The
entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) or (d) of this Section shall be 
prima facie
 evidence
of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; 
provided
 that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative
Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(f)            
Any
Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) in
a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all
times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form.

In
the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf of any Loan Party or any Subsidiary in respect of any
Prepayment Event, the Borrowers shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds are received by such Loan Party or any Subsidiary, prepay the
Obligations and cash collateralize the LC Exposure as set forth in Section 2.11(d) below in an aggregate amount equal to 100%
of such Net Proceeds, 
provided
 that, in the case of any event described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition of
the term “Prepayment Event”, if the Borrower Representative shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial
Officer to the effect that the Loan Parties intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate),
within 180 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to acquire (or replace or rebuild) real property, equipment or other tangible
assets (excluding inventory) to be used in the business of the Loan Parties, and certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing,
then either (i) so long as a Cash Dominion Period is not in effect, no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in
respect of the Net Proceeds specified in such certificate or (ii) if a Cash Dominion Period is in effect, then, if the Net Proceeds
specified in such certificate are to be applied to acquire, replace or rebuild such assets by (A) the Borrowers, such Net Proceeds

of the Revolving Commitment) and upon such application, the Administrative Agent shall establish a Reserve against the Borrowing Base
in an amount equal to the amount of such proceeds so applied and (B) any Loan Party that is not a Borrower, such Net Proceeds shall
be deposited in a cash collateral account, and in the case of either (A) or (B), thereafter, such funds shall be made available to
the applicable Loan Party as follows:
63
(i)            
the
Borrower Representative shall request a Revolving Borrowing (specifying that the request is to use Net Proceeds pursuant to this Section)
or the applicable Loan Party shall request a release from the cash collateral account be made in the amount needed;
(ii)            
so
long as the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 have been met, the Revolving Lenders shall make such Revolving Borrowing or the
Administrative Agent shall release funds from the cash collateral account; and
(iii)            
in
the case of Net Proceeds applied against the Revolving Borrowing, the Reserve established with respect to such proceeds shall be reduced
by the amount of such Revolving Borrowing;
provided
that to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such 90-day period, a prepayment shall
be required at such time in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied.
(d)       
(i)        
All prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11(a) shall be applied to prepay Revolving Loans in accordance with the
Lenders’ respective Applicable Percentages without a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Commitments and, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure to the extent required by this Agreement.
(ii)            
All
such amounts pursuant to Section 2.11(c) shall be applied, 
first
 to prepay any Protective Advances and Overadvances that
may be outstanding, pro rata, 
second
 to prepay the Revolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) without a corresponding reduction
in the Revolving Commitments and, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure

second
 to prepay
the Revolving Loans (including Swingline Loans) without a corresponding reduction in the Revolving Commitments and, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, to cash collateralize outstanding LC Exposure to the extent required by this Agreement. If the precise
amount of insurance or condemnation proceeds allocable to Inventory as compared to Equipment, Fixtures and real property is not otherwise
determined, the allocation and application of those proceeds shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, in its Permitted Discretion
.
64
(iii)            
The
Borrower Representative shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender)
by telephone (confirmed by email), through Electronic System, or the Approved Borrower Portal, in each case to the extent arrangements
for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender),

if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating
to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided
in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid
Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (x) accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13 and (y) break

Alternate
Rate of Interest
.
(a)            
Subject
to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this Section 2.14, if:
(i)            
the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term
SOFR Rate (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for such Interest Period,
(B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate (including because
the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis), or (C) at any time, that adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR; or; or
67
(ii)            
the
Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark
Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or, in
the event there is only one Lender hereunder, such Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing
for such Interest Period, (B) at any time, the Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
(or, in the event there is only one Lender hereunder, such Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such
Borrowing, or (C) at any time, the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing; then the Administrative Agent shall
give notice thereof to the Borrower Representative and the Lenders through Electronic System as provided in Section 9.01 as promptly
as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower Representative and the Lenders that the circumstances
giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower Representative delivers a
new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms
of Section 2.03, (1) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any
Borrowing as, a Term Benchmark Borrowing and any Borrowing Request that requests a Term Benchmark Borrowing shall instead be deemed to
be an Interest Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple
SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.14(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) a CBFR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple
SOFR also is the subject of Section 2.14(a)(i) or (ii) above and (2) any Borrowing Request that requests an Adjusted
REVSOFR30 Rate Borrowing or an RFR Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for a CBFR Borrowing; provided
that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted.
Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan, Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower Representative’s
receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.14(a)
with respect to a Relevant Rate
applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies
the Borrower Representative and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant
Benchmark and (y) the Borrowers deliver a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new
Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as
the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.14(a)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, or (y) a
CBFR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR also is the subject of Section 2.14(a)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, and (2) any
Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or any RFR Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute
a CBFR Loan.
(b)            
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date
have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement
is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement
Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark (including any related adjustments) for all purposes hereunder and under
any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or
consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance
with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement
will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 6:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the
Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long
as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders.
68
(c)            
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments
implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party
to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(d)            
The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower Representative and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition
Event, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (f) below and (v) the commencement
or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent
or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14, including any determination with respect to a
tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain
from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion
and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant
to this Section 2.14.
(e)            
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark
Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate or REVSOFR30 Rate) and either (A) any
tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected
by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark
has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative,
then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time
to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either
(A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is
not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark
Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or
after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

any request for (i) a Term Benchmark Borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted
or continued or (ii) an Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Borrowing or a RFR Borrowing, or conversion to an Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or
RFR Loan, during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrowers will be deemed to have converted (1) any such
request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted
Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) a CBFR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is
the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (2) any such request for an Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Borrowing or RFR Borrowing into
a request for a CBFR Borrowing. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan, Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the
date of the Borrower Representative’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to
a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark
Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.14, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Loan so long as the
Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day or (y) a CBFR Loan if the Adjusted Daily
Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day and (2) any Adjusted REVSOFR30 Rate Loan or RFR Loan shall
on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute a CBFR Loan.

definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; and the result of any of the foregoing shall
be to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any
Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient
of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing
Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrowers will pay to such Lender, Issuing

Section 2.17.       
Withholding
of Taxes; Gross-Up
. (a) 
Payments Free of Taxes
. Any and all payments
by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes,
except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding
agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding
agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable
Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)            
Payment
of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties
. The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable

Administrative Agent.
(d)            
Indemnification

payable under this Section 2.17) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such
Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to any Loan Party by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Failure or delay on the part of any Recipient to demand compensation pursuant
to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Recipient’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Loan
Parties shall not be required to compensate a Recipient pursuant to this Section for any Indemnified Taxes incurred more than 270
days prior to the date that such Recipient notifies the Loan Parties; 
provided further
 that, if such Indemnified Taxes are as a
result of an event that is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.
(e)            
Indemnification
by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for
(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of

Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes
the Administrative Agent to setoff and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this
paragraph (e).
(f)       
Status
of Lenders
. (i)
Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from
or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower Representative and
the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, such
properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested
by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine
whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth
in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment
such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material (as determined by such Lender) unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially (as determined by such Lender) prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
73
(ii)            
Without

the Code (a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”) and (y) an executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E,
as applicable; or
74
(4)            
to
the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, an executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS
Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2
or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; 
provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio
interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-4 on
behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)            
any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent

to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed
by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed
by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower Representative or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
75
Each Lender agrees that if
any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form
or certification or promptly notify the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)            
Treatment
of Certain Refunds

Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying
party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph
(g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified
party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g),
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the
payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been
in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification
payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This paragraph (g) shall not be construed to require
any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to
the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)            
Survival
.
Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any

LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time,
on the date when due or the date fixed for any prepayment hereunder, in immediately available funds, without setoff, recoupment or counterclaim.

Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Floor L2, Chicago, Illinois, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing
Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be

hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day,
and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder
shall be made in dollars.
76
(b)            
All
payments and any proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent (i) not constituting (A) a specific payment of
principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrowers), (B) a
mandatory prepayment (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.11) or (C) amounts to be applied from the Collection

the Borrowers (other than in connection with Banking Services Obligations or Swap Agreement Obligations), 
second
, to pay any fees,

fourth
,

Swap Agreement Obligations up to and including the amount most recently provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.22
and to the extent not paid pursuant to clause sixth above, and 
eighth
, to the payment of any other Secured Obligation due to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrowers
. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing amounts received from any Loan Party shall
not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of such Loan Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
unless so directed by the Borrower Representative, or unless a Default is in existence, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender
shall apply any payment which it receives to any Term Benchmark Loan of a Class, except (x) on the expiration date of the Interest
Period applicable thereto or (y) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding CBFR Loans of the same Class and,
in any such event, the Borrowers shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.16. The Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments
to any portion of the Secured Obligations.
(c)            
At
the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses
(including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees, costs and expenses pursuant to Section 9.03), and other sums payable
under the Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by the Borrower
Representative pursuant to Section 2.03 or a deemed request as provided in this Section or may be deducted from any deposit
account of any Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent. The Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorize (i) the Administrative
Agent to make a Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other
amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans and Overadvances,
but such a Borrowing may only constitute a Protective Advance if it is to reimburse costs, fees and expenses as described in Section 9.03)
and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05, as applicable, and (ii) the
Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of any Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal,
interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents.
77
(d)            
If,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain
payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other similarly situated Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans
of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by all such Lenders ratably in accordance
with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline
Loans; 
provided
 that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto
is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest,
and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale
of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other
than to the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(e)            
Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received, prior to any date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks pursuant to the terms hereof or any other Loan Document (including any date that is fixed for prepayment
by notice from the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.11(e), notice from the Borrower Representative
that the Borrowers will not make such payment or prepayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment
on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the
case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing
Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding
the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the NYFRB Rate.
78
(f)            
The
Administrative Agent may from time to time provide the Borrowers with account statements or invoices with respect to any of the Secured
Obligations (the “
Statements
”). The Administrative Agent is under no duty or obligation to provide Statements, which,
if provided, will be solely for the Borrowers’ convenience. Statements may contain estimates of the amounts owed during the relevant
billing period, whether of principal, interest, fees or other Secured Obligations. If the Borrowers pay the full amount indicated on a
Statement on or before the due date indicated on such Statement, the Borrowers shall not be in default of payment with respect to the
billing period indicated on such Statement; 
provided
, that acceptance by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, of
any payment that is less than the total amount actually due at that time (including but not limited to any past due amounts) shall not
constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent’s or the Lenders’ right to receive payment in full at another time.
Section 2.19.       
Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
(a)            
If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional
amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall
use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would
not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.
(b)            
If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional
amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes
a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04),
all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this
Agreement and other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); 
provided
 that (i) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent (and in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 9.04, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender),
which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all
other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or
the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of
a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Each party hereto agrees that (x) an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption executed by the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement
incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent
and such parties are participants), and (y) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for
such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; 
provided
 that, following
the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to
evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, 
provided
 that any such documents shall be without recourse
to or warranty by the parties thereto.

Section 2.20.       
Defaulting
Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following
provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)            
fees
shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a);
(b)            
any
payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether
voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 2.18(b) or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from
a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent
as follows: 
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; 
second
,
to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder; 
third
,
to cash collateralize the LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Section; 
fourth
, as the Borrower
Representative may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting
Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; 
fifth
,
if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in
order to (i) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement
and (ii) cash collateralize future LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued
under this Agreement, in accordance with this Section; 
sixth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks
or Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Banks or Swingline
Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or
under any other Loan Document; 
seventh
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to
the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Borrower against such Defaulting Lender
as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and 
eighth
,
to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; 
provided
 that if (x) such payment
is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded
its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set
forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed
to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to,
such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in the Borrowers’ obligations corresponding
to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments
without giving effect to clause (d) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that
are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed
paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto;
80
(c)            
such
Defaulting Lender shall not have the right to vote on any issue on which voting is required (other than to the extent expressly provided
in Section 9.02(b)) and the Commitment and Revolving Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether
the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification
pursuant to Section 9.02) or under any other Loan Document; provided, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02(b),
the vote of a Defaulting Lender shall not be required in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent
of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby;
(d)            
if
any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i)            
all
or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders
in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that such reallocation does not, as to any non-Defaulting
Lender, cause such non-Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Exposure to exceed its Revolving Commitment;
(ii)            
if
the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one (1) Business
Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) 
first
, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) 
second
, cash
collateralize, for the benefit of the Issuing Banks, the Borrowers’ obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s
LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
81
(iii)            
if
the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrowers
shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting
Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv)            
if
the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant
to Sections 2.12(a) and 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Percentages;
and
(v)            
if
all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit
fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing
Banks until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(e)            
so
long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend, renew, extend or increase any Letter of
Credit, unless it is satisfied that such Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments
of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 2.20(d), and LC
Exposure related to any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent
with Section 2.20(d)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
If (i) a Bankruptcy Event
or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Lender Parent shall occur following the date hereof and for so long as such event shall continue
or (ii) any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other
agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of
Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrowers or such Lender, satisfactory to such Issuing
Bank to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
I
n
the event that each of the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and each Issuing Bank agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied
all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion
of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment and on the date of such readjustment such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of
the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to
hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
Section 2.21.       
Returned
Payments
. If after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations (including a payment
effected through exercise of a right of setoff), the Administrative Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such
payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined
to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason (including pursuant
to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion), then the Obligations or part thereof intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not
been received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender. The provisions of this Section 2.21 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding
any contrary action which may have been taken by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or application of
proceeds. The provisions of this Section 2.21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
82

Services and Swap Agreements

Swap Agreements with, any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent, promptly
after entering into such Banking Services or Swap Agreements, written notice setting forth the aggregate amount of all Banking Services
Obligations and Swap Agreement Obligations of such Loan Party or Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to such Lender or Affiliate (whether
matured or unmatured, absolute or contingent). In addition, each such Lender or Affiliate thereof shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent, following the end of each calendar month, a summary of the amounts due or to become due in respect of such Banking Services Obligations
and Swap Agreement Obligations. The most recent information provided to the Administrative Agent shall be used in determining the amounts
to be applied in respect of such Banking Services Obligations and/or Swap Agreement Obligations pursuant to Section 2.18(b) and
which tier of the waterfall, contained in Section 2.18(b), such Banking Services Obligations and/or Swap Agreement Obligations will
be placed. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as JPMCB or its Affiliate is the Administrative Agent, neither JPMCB nor any of its Affiliates
providing Banking Services for, or having Swap Agreements with, any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Loan Party shall be
required to provide any notice described in this Section 2.22 in respect of such Banking Services or Swap Agreements.

Security
Interest in Collateral
. The provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents create legal and valid Liens on all of the Collateral

on the Collateral, securing the Secured Obligations, enforceable against the applicable Loan Party and all third parties, and having priority

the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, but ratably as among the Classes of Loans and the Loans of each
Class at the time outstanding, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared to be
due and payable), whereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued interest thereon and all
fees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any break funding payments) and other obligations of the Borrowers accrued hereunder and

and under any other Loan Documents, shall automatically become due and payable, in each case without presentment, demand, protest or other

Article VIII
The Administrative Agent
Section 8.01.       
Authorization
and Action
.
(a)            
Each
Lender, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the entity
named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors and assigns to serve as the administrative agent and
collateral agent under the Loan Documents and each Lender and each Issuing Bank authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions
as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent under such agreements and to exercise such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In addition, to the extent required under
the laws of any jurisdiction other than within the United States, each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby grants to the Administrative
Agent any required powers of attorney to execute and enforce any Collateral Document governed by the laws of such jurisdiction on such
Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s behalf. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes
the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to which the Administrative
Agent is a party, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that the Administrative Agent may have under such Loan Documents.
(b)            
As
to any matters not expressly provided for herein and in the other Loan Documents (including enforcement or collection), the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and
shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, pursuant to the terms in the Loan Documents), and, unless and until revoked
in writing, such instructions shall be binding upon each Lender and each Issuing Bank; 
provided
, 
however
, that the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to take any action that (i) the Administrative Agent in good faith believes exposes it to liability unless
the Administrative Agent receives an indemnification and is exculpated in a manner satisfactory to it from the Lenders and the Issuing
Banks with respect to such action or (ii) is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, including any
action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
or relief of debtors or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any
requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors; 
provided
, 
further
, that the
Administrative Agent may seek clarification or direction from the Required Lenders prior to the exercise of any such instructed action
and may refrain from acting until such clarification or direction has been provided. Except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents,
the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating
to any Borrower, any other Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing that is communicated to or obtained by
the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Administrative
Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or
in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
123
(c)            
In
performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf
of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (except in limited circumstances expressly provided for herein relating to the maintenance of the
Register), and its duties are entirely mechanical and administrative in nature. The motivations of the Administrative Agent are commercial
in nature and not to invest in the general performance or operations of the Borrowers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(i)            
the
Administrative Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or duty or any other relationship as the agent,
fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender, any Issuing Bank, or any other Secured Party other than as expressly set forth herein and in
the other Loan Documents, regardless of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood
and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine
of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between contracting parties); additionally, each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative
Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and
(ii)            
nothing
in this Agreement or any Loan Document shall require the Administrative Agent to account to any Lender for any sum or the profit element
of any sum received by the Administrative Agent for its own account.
(d)            
The
Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or
through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform
any of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities pursuant to this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any sub agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and
non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.
(e)            
None
of any syndication agent, any co-documentation agent or any arranger shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons
shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.
(f)            
In
case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership
or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any reimbursement
obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective
of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on any Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(i)            
to
file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Disbursements and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03)
allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
124
(ii)            
to
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender, each Issuing Bank and each
other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to
the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent
any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03). Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Lender or Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any
Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Bank in any such
proceeding.
(g)           
The
provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and, except
solely to the extent of the Borrowers’ right to consent pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article, no
Borrower nor any Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary under any such
provisions. Each Secured Party, whether or not a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and
of the Guarantees of the Secured Obligations provided under the Loan Documents, to have agreed to the provisions of this Article.

as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents) or
(y) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders
for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement

Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection

means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page) or for any failure of any Loan Party to perform its obligations hereunder
or thereunder.
125
(b)            
The
Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any (i) notice of any of the events or circumstances set forth or described
in Section 5.02 unless and until written notice thereof stating that it is a “notice under Section 5.02” in respect
of this Agreement and identifying the specific clause under said Section is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower Representative,
or (ii) notice of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a “notice of

or (vi) the creation, perfection or priority of Liens on the Collateral.

issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, may presume that

from such Lender or Issuing Bank sufficiently in advance of the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit and (vi) shall
be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon,
any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which writing may be a fax, any electronic message, Internet or
intranet website posting or other distribution) or any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be genuine and
signed or sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper party or parties (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set
forth in the Loan Documents for being the maker thereof).
126
Section 8.03.       
Posting
of Communications

(a)            
The
Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders and
the Issuing Banks by posting the Communications on IntraLinks™, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other electronic system chosen
by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “
Approved Electronic Platform

(b)            
Although
the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented
or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Effective Date, a user ID/password authorization system)
and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic
Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the distribution
of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or
vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality
and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders, each Issuing Bank and each Borrower hereby approves distribution
of the Communications through the Approved Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution.
(c)            
THE
APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. THE APPLICABLE

The Person serving as the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with, any
Loan Party, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing as if such Person was not acting as the Administrative Agent and without

Section 8.05.       
Successor
Administrative Agent

(a)            
The
Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior written notice thereof to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and
the Borrower Representative, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s
giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York or an Affiliate of any such bank. In either
case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower Representative (which approval may not be unreasonably
withheld and shall not be required while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Administrative Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with,
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of appointment as Administrative
Agent by a successor Administrative Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Prior to any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as Administrative
Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Administrative
Agent its rights as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.
128
(b)            
Notwithstanding
paragraph (a) of this Section, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Administrative
Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrowers, whereupon, on the date
of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; 
provided
 that, solely for purposes of maintaining any security interest
granted to the Administrative Agent under any Collateral Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring Administrative
Agent shall continue to be vested with such security interest as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and continue
to be entitled to the rights set forth in such Collateral Document and Loan Document, and, in the case of any Collateral in the possession
of the Administrative Agent, shall continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until such time as a successor Administrative Agent
is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this Section (it being understood and agreed that the retiring Administrative
Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any further action under any Collateral Document, including any action required to maintain
the perfection of any such security interest), and (ii) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent; 
provided
 that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder
or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be
made directly to such Person and (B) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative
Agent shall directly be given or made to each Lender and Issuing Bank. Following the effectiveness of the Administrative Agent’s
resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article, Section 2.17(d) and Section 9.03, as well as any
exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit
of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and in respect of the matters referred
to in the proviso under clause (a) above.

Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative Agent has determined in
its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment,

Payment

Each
Lender hereby further agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is
in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “

Section 8.07.       
Collateral
Matters
.
(a)            
Except
with respect to the exercise of setoff rights in accordance with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Secured Party’s right to
file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral
or to enforce any Guarantee of the Secured Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the
Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof.
In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a “representative” of the Secured Parties within the meaning of the term “secured
party” as defined in the UCC. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the
Secured Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on
behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the
Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties.
(b)            
In
furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no arrangements in respect of Banking Services the obligations under which
constitute Secured Obligations and no Swap Agreement the obligations under which constitute Secured Obligations, will create (or be deemed
to create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management or release of any Collateral
or of the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that
is a party to any such arrangement in respect of Banking Services or Swap Agreement, as applicable, shall be deemed to have appointed
the Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the
Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.
(c)            
The
Secured Parties irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to subordinate any Lien on any property
granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by
Sections 6.02(b), 6.02(d) of 6.02(e). The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire
into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection
of the Administrative Agent’s Lien thereon or any certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the
Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion
of the Collateral.
132
Section 8.08.       
Credit
Bidding
. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit
bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the
Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more
acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy
Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan
Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent
or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection
with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by
the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated
claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in
an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset
or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection
with such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more acquisition
vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’
ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned
to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents
providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (
provided
 that any actions by the Administrative Agent with
respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed,
directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted
assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case
may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders
contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles
shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests,
whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or
debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further
action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for
any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds
the amount of Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the
Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any
acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition
vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned
to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide
such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments
issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition
vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

. JPMCB has adopted internal policies and procedures that address requirements placed on federally regulated lenders under applicable
Flood Laws. JPMCB, as administrative agent or collateral agent on a syndicated facility, will post on the applicable electronic platform
(or otherwise distribute to each Lender in the syndicate) documents that it receives in connection with the Flood Laws. However, JPMCB

The
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks agree that, pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Borrower Communications to the Administrative Agent through an electronic platform chosen
by the Administrative Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the “

Waivers;
Amendments
. (a) 
No failure or delay by the Administrative
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent
to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of
this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of
any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

Except

or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, with the
consent of the Required Lenders; 
provided
 that no such agreement shall (A) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender), (B) reduce or forgive the principal amount
of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce or forgive any interest or fees payable hereunder, without
the written consent of each Lender (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender) directly affected thereby (
provided
that (x) any amendment or modification of the financial covenants in this Agreement (or any defined term used therein) shall not
constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (B) and (y) only the consent of Required
Lenders shall be necessary to adjust the default interest set forth in Section 2.13(d) or to waive any obligation to pay interest
at such rate) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (B), (C) postpone any
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any date for the payment of any interest, fees or

of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender (including any such Lender that is a Defaulting Lender) directly affected
thereby, (D) change Section 2.09(d) or Section 2.18(b) or (d) in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction

of the Collateral, without the written consent of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lender); 
provided
, 
further
, that
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be (it being understood that any amendment to Section 2.20 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Banks and the Swingline Lender); 
provided further
 that no such agreement shall amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.06
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks. The Administrative Agent may also amend the

or any other Loan Document that by its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Lenders of one or more Classes (but
not the Lenders of any other Class), may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the requisite
number or percentage in interest of each affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this Section if
such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time.
139
(c)            
The
Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release
any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral (i) upon Payment in Full of all Secured Obligations,
and the cash collateralization of all Unliquidated Obligations in a manner satisfactory to each affected Lender, (ii) constituting
property being sold or disposed of if the Loan Party disposing of such property certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale or
disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate,
without further inquiry), and to the extent that the property being sold or disposed of constitutes 100% of the Equity Interests of a
Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent is authorized to release any Loan Guaranty or Obligation Guaranty provided by such Subsidiary, (iii) constituting
property leased to a Loan Party under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, or
(iv) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of such Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article VII. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent will not release
any Liens on Collateral without the prior written authorization of the Required Lenders; 
provided
 that, the Administrative Agent
may in its discretion, release its Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $2,500,000 during any calendar year without
the prior written authorization of the Required Lenders (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on one or
more certificates of the Borrowers as to the value of any Collateral to be so released, without further inquiry). Any such release
shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or
obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of
which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. Any execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent of documents in connection
with any such release shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
(d)            
If,
in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender
affected thereby,” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any
such Lender whose consent is necessary but has not been obtained being referred to herein as a “
Non-Consenting Lender
”),
then the Borrowers may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, 
provided
 that, concurrently
with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent
and the Issuing Banks shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of
the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04,
and (ii) the Borrowers shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest,
fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrowers hereunder to and including the date of termination,
including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any,
equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of
such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment
required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower Representative,
the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference
pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and the Lender required
to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented
to and be bound by the terms thereof; 
provided
 that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such
assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable
Lender, 
provided
 that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.
140
(e)            
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower Representative only, amend, modify or supplement

Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (iii) the Borrowers,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; 
provided
 that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender
will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that
affects such Participant. The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and
2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) and (g) (it
being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender and the
information and documentation required under Section 2.17(g) will be delivered to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent))
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section;
provided
 that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an
assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15
or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such
entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.
146
Each Lender that sells a participation
agrees, at the Borrowers’ request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions
of Section 2.19(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, 
provided
 such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(b) as
though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest)
of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “
Participant
Register
”); 
provided
 that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters
of Credit or its other obligations under this Agreement) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United
States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement
notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(d)            
Any
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations
of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall
not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; 
provided
 that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest
shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

and in the other Loan Documents and each Credit Party is acting solely in the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty
to each Borrower with respect to the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated herein and therein and not as a financial advisor
or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, any Borrower or any other person. Each Borrower agrees that it will not assert any claim against any
Credit Party based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by such Credit Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Additionally, each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Credit Party is advising any Borrower as to any legal,
tax, investment, accounting, regulatory or any other matters in any jurisdiction. Each Borrower shall consult with its own advisors concerning
such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated herein
or in the other Loan Documents, and the Credit Parties shall have no responsibility or liability to any Borrower with respect thereto.
154
(b)            
Each
Borrower further acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Subsidiaries’ understanding, that each Credit Party, together with
its Affiliates, in addition to providing or participating in commercial lending facilities such as that provided hereunder, is a full
service securities or banking firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing investment banking and
other financial services. In the ordinary course of business, any Credit Party may provide investment banking and other financial services
to, and/or acquire, hold or sell, for its own accounts and the accounts of customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial
instruments (including bank loans and other obligations) of, any Borrower and other companies with which any Borrower may have commercial

affiliates may be providing debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial advisory services) to other companies
in respect of which a Borrower may have conflicting interests regarding the transactions described herein and otherwise. No Credit Party
will use confidential information obtained from any Borrower by virtue of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents or its other
relationships with such Borrower in connection with the performance by such Credit Party of services for other companies, and no Credit
Party will furnish any such information to other companies. Each Borrower also acknowledges that no Credit Party has any obligation to
use in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, or to furnish to any Borrower, confidential information obtained
from other companies.
Section 9.21.       
Acknowledgement
Regarding Any Supported QFCs
. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements
or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “
QFC Credit Support
” and each such QFC a “
Supported
QFC
”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the
regulations promulgated thereunder, the “
U.S. Special Resolution Regimes
”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC
Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated
to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity
that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “
Covered Party
”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such
Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the
United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject
to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported
QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than
such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed
by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect
to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

ach Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees it is jointly
and severally liable to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders for the Secured Obligations. In furtherance thereof,
each Borrower agrees that wherever in this Agreement it is provided that a Borrower is liable for a payment, such obligation is the joint
and several obligation of each Borrower. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that its joint and several liability under this Agreement
and the Loan Documents is absolute and unconditional and shall not in any manner be affected or impaired by any acts or omissions whatsoever
by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person. Each Borrower’s liability for the Secured Obligations
shall not in any manner be impaired or affected by who receives or uses the proceeds of the credit extended hereunder or for what purposes
such proceeds are used, and each Borrower waives notice of borrowing requests issued by, and loans or other extensions of credit made
to, other Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby agrees not to exercise or enforce any right of exoneration, contribution, reimbursement, recourse
or subrogation available to such Borrower against any party liable for payment under this Agreement and the Loan Documents unless and
until the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender have been paid in full and all of the Secured Obligations are satisfied
and discharged following termination or expiration of all commitments of the Lenders to extend credit to the Borrowers. Each Borrower’s
joint and several liability hereunder with respect to the Secured Obligations shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
be the unconditional liability of such Borrower irrespective of (i) the validity, enforceability, avoidance or subordination of any
of the Secured Obligations or of any other document evidencing all or any part of the Secured Obligations, (ii) the absence of any
attempt to collect any of the Secured Obligations from any other Loan Party or any Collateral or other security therefor, or the absence
of any other action to enforce the same, (iii) the amendment, modification, waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of
any indulgence by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument executed by any other Loan Party
evidencing or securing the payment of any of the Secured Obligations, or any other agreement now or hereafter executed by any other Loan
Party and delivered to the Administrative Agent, (iv) the failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take any steps to
perfect or maintain the perfected status of its Lien upon, or to preserve its rights to, any of the Collateral or other security for the
payment or performance of any of the Secured Obligations or the Administrative Agent’s release of any Collateral or of its Liens
upon any Collateral, (v) the release or compromise, in whole or in part, of the liability of any other Loan Party for the payment
of any of the Secured Obligations, (vi) any increase in the amount of the Secured Obligations beyond any limits imposed herein or
in the amount of any interest, fees or other charges payable in connection therewith, in each case, if consented to by any other Borrower,
or any decrease in the same, or (vii) any other circumstance that might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of any
Loan Party. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may proceed directly and
at once, without notice to any Borrower, against any or all of the Loan Parties to collect and recover all or any part of the Secured
Obligations, without first proceeding against any other Loan Party or against any Collateral or other security for the payment or performance
of any of the Secured Obligations, and each Borrower waives any provision that might otherwise require the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders under applicable law to pursue or exhaust remedies against any Collateral or other Loan Party before pursuing such Borrower or
its property. Each Borrower consents and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to
marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or against or in payment of any or all of the Secured Obligations.

Article X
Loan Guaranty
Section 10.01.       
Guaranty
.
Each Loan Guarantor hereby agrees that it is jointly and severally liable for, and, as a primary obligor and not merely as surety, absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Secured Parties, the prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration
or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of the Secured Obligations and all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, all court
costs and attorneys’ and paralegals’ fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and
the Lenders in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Secured Obligations from, or in prosecuting any action against, any Borrower,
any Loan Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Secured Obligations (such costs and expenses, together with the Secured
Obligations, collectively the “
Guaranteed Obligations
”; 
provided, however
, that the definition of “Guaranteed
Obligations” shall not create any guarantee by any Loan Guarantor of (or grant of security interest by any Loan Guarantor to support,
as applicable) any Excluded Swap Obligations of such Loan Guarantor for purposes of determining any obligations of any Loan Guarantor).
Each Loan Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed in whole or in part without notice to or
further assent from it, and that it remains bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any such extension or renewal. All terms of this
Loan Guaranty apply to and may be enforced by or on behalf of any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of any Lender that extended
any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 10.02.       
Guaranty
of Payment
. This Loan Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Each Loan Guarantor waives any right to require the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to sue any Borrower, any Loan Guarantor, any other guarantor of, or any other Person
obligated for, all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (each, an “
Obligated Party
”), or otherwise to enforce
its payment against any collateral securing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations.
157
Section 10.03.       
No
Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty
. (a) 
Except
as otherwise provided for herein, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any
reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including:
(i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower or any other
Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
affecting any Obligated Party or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party; or (iv) the
existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any Obligated Party, the Administrative
Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions.
(b)            
The
obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever
by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable
law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof.
(c)            
Further,
the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Administrative
Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iii) any release, non-perfection or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of any Borrower for all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any
action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender with respect to any collateral securing any part
of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk
of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than Payment
in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations).
Section 10.04.     
Defenses
Waived
. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of
any defense of any Borrower or any Loan Guarantor or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause,
or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower, any Loan Guarantor or any other Obligated Party, other than Payment
in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance
hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement
that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Obligated Party or any other Person. Each Loan Guarantor confirms that
it is not a surety under any state law and shall not raise any such law as a defense to its obligations hereunder. The Administrative
Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment
of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any collateral securing all or a part of
the Guaranteed Obligations, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated
Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been Paid in Full. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election
may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of
any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security.
158
Section 10.05.       
Rights
of Subrogation
. No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation,
contribution or indemnification, that it has against any Obligated Party or any collateral, until the Loan Parties and the Loan Guarantors
have fully performed all their obligations to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders.
Section 10.06.       
Reinstatement;
Stay of Acceleration
. If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations (including a payment effected through
exercise of a right of setoff) is rescinded, or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
of any Borrower or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Secured Party in its discretion), each Loan Guarantor’s
obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been
made and whether or not the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders are in possession of this Loan Guaranty. If acceleration
of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower,
all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless
be payable by the Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.
Section 10.07.       
Information
.
Each Loan Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrowers’ financial condition and assets,
and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the
risks that each Loan Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank or any Lender shall have any duty to advise any Loan Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
Section 10.08.       
Termination
.
Each of the Lenders and Issuing Banks may continue to make loans or extend credit to the Borrowers based on this Loan Guaranty until five
(5) days after it receives written notice of termination from any Loan Guarantor. Notwithstanding receipt of any such notice, each
Loan Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Lenders for any Guaranteed Obligations created, assumed or committed to prior to the
fifth day after receipt of the notice, and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments with respect to, or substitutions
for, all or any part of such Guaranteed Obligations. Nothing in this Section 10.08 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or
eliminate, limit, reduce or otherwise impair any rights or remedies the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have in respect of, any
Default or Event of Default that shall exist under Section 7.01 hereof as a result of any such notice of termination.
159
Section 10.09.       
Taxes
.
Each payment of the Guaranteed Obligations will be made by each Loan Guarantor without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding
is required by law. If any Loan Guarantor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold
Taxes, then such Loan Guarantor may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Guarantor shall be increased
as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section),
the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding
been made.
Section 10.10.       
Maximum
Liability
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Loan Guarantor hereunder shall
be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548
of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Voidable
Transactions Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Loan Guarantor’s
obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification
or contribution which such Loan Guarantor may have under this Loan Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into
account.
Section 10.11.       
Contribution
.
(a)            
To
the extent that any Loan Guarantor shall make a payment under this Loan Guaranty (a “
Guarantor Payment
”) which, taking
into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Loan Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise
would have been paid by or attributable to such Loan Guarantor if each Loan Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied
by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Loan Guarantor’s “Allocable Amount” (as defined below) (as
determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Loan Guarantors as determined
immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guarantor Payment
and Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of this Agreement, such Loan Guarantor shall be entitled to receive
contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Loan Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata
based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
(b)            
As
of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of any Loan Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable
value of the property of such Loan Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Loan Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably
expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Loan Guarantor that
is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Loan Guarantors
as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions.
160
(c)            
This
Section 10.11 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Loan Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 10.11
is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Loan Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same
shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Loan Guaranty.
(d)            
The
parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Loan Guarantor
or Loan Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.
(e)            
The
rights of the indemnifying Loan Guarantors against other Loan Guarantors under this Section 10.11 shall be exercisable upon Payment
in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
Section 10.12.       
Liability
Cumulative
. The liability of each Loan Party as a Loan Guarantor under this Article X is in addition to and shall be cumulative
with all liabilities of each Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Parties, without
any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the
contrary.
Section 10.13.       
Keepwell
.
Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds
or other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under this Guarantee in respect
of a Swap Obligation (
provided
, 
however
, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 10.13
for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section 10.13 or
otherwise under this Loan Guaranty voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for
any greater amount). Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 10.13
shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of all Swap Obligations. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.13
constitute, and this Section 10.13 shall be deemed to constitute, a “keepwell, support, or other agreement” for the benefit
of each other Loan Party for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
161

notice of sole control or any other instruction under any Deposit Account Control Agreement, Securities Account Control Agreement or

notice (except as specifically provided in Section 8.1 or elsewhere herein), demand or advertisement of any kind to any Grantor
or any other Person, enter the premises of any Grantor where any Collateral is located (through self-help and without judicial process)
to inventory, collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, sell, lease, assign, grant an option or options to purchase or otherwise
dispose of, deliver, or realize upon, the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales (which
sales may be adjourned or continued from time to time with or without notice and may take place at any Grantor’s premises or elsewhere),
for cash, on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, and upon such other terms as the Administrative Agent
may deem commercially reasonable; and
17
(v)            concurrently
with written notice to the applicable Grantor, transfer and register in its name or in the name of its nominee the whole or any part
of the Pledged Collateral, exchange certificates or instruments representing or evidencing Pledged Collateral for certificates or instruments
of smaller or larger denominations, exercise the voting and all other rights as a holder with respect thereto, to collect and receive
all cash dividends, interest, principal and other distributions made thereon and to otherwise act with respect to the Pledged Collateral
as though the Administrative Agent was the outright owner thereof.
(b)            The
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may comply with any applicable state or federal law requirements in connection
with a disposition of the Collateral and compliance will not be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale
of the Collateral.
(c)            The
Administrative Agent shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private
sale or sales, to purchase for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, the whole or any part of the Collateral
so sold, free of any right of equity redemption, which equity redemption each Grantor hereby expressly releases.
(d)            Until
the Administrative Agent is able to effect a sale, lease, or other disposition of Collateral, the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to hold or use Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving Collateral
or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may, if it so elects,
seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of Collateral and to enforce any of the Administrative Agent’s

notice or hearing as to such appointment.

to the Collateral or any such guarantee in any particular order, or (iii) effect a public sale of any Collateral.
(f)             Each
Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Collateral and may be
compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof in accordance with 
clause (a)
 above. Each Grantor also acknowledges
that any private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding
such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall not be deemed to have been made in a commercially unreasonable manner solely
by virtue of such sale being private. The Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Collateral
for the period of time necessary to permit any Grantor or the issuer of the Pledged Collateral to register such securities for public
sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under applicable state securities laws, even if the applicable Grantor and the
issuer would agree to do so.
(g)            If,
after the Credit Agreement has terminated by its terms and all of the Obligations have been Paid in Full, there remain Swap Agreement
Obligations outstanding, the Required Secured Parties may exercise the remedies provided in this Section 5.2 upon the occurrence
of any event which would allow or require the termination or acceleration of any Swap Agreement Obligations pursuant to the terms of

Agent, or cause an issuer of Pledged Collateral to furnish to the Administrative Agent, any information regarding the Pledged Collateral
in such detail as the Administrative Agent may specify;

Exhibit B
, and (ii) at the request of the Administrative
Agent, establish lock box service (the “

in the form provided by or otherwise acceptable to the Administrative Agent and shall be accompanied by an acknowledgment by the bank
where the Lock Box is located of the Lien of the Administrative Agent granted hereunder and of irrevocable instructions to wire all amounts

After the Closing Date, each Grantor will comply with the terms of Section 7.2.
21
(b)            Each
Grantor shall direct all of its Account Debtors to forward payments directly to Lock Boxes subject to Lock Box Agreements or Collateral
Deposit Account. The Administrative Agent shall have sole access to the Lock Boxes at all times and each Grantor shall take all actions
necessary to grant the Administrative Agent such sole access. At no time shall any Grantor remove any item from a Lock Box or a Collateral
Deposit Account without the Administrative Agent’s prior written consent. If any Grantor should refuse or neglect to notify any
Account Debtor to forward payments in accordance with this Section 7.1 after notice from the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent shall, notwithstanding the language set forth in Section 6.2(b), be entitled to make such notification directly to such Account
Debtor. If notwithstanding the foregoing instructions, any Grantor receives any proceeds of any Receivables or other Collateral or any

Agent’s trustee, and shall immediately deposit all cash, checks or other similar payments received by it to a Collateral Deposit
Account. All funds deposited into any Lock Box subject to a Lock Box Agreement or a Collateral Deposit Account will be swept on a daily
basis into a collection account maintained by such Grantor with the Administrative Agent (the “

each Grantor shall (a) obtain the Administrative Agent’s consent in writing to the opening of such Collateral Deposit Account
or other Deposit Account or establishing of such Lock Box, and (b) cause each bank or financial institution or securities intermediary
in which it seeks to open (i) a Collateral Deposit Account or other Deposit Account, to enter into a Deposit Account Control Agreement
with the Administrative Agent in order to give the Administrative Agent Control of such Collateral Deposit Account or other Deposit Account
and provide for a daily sweep into the Collection Account or another account designated by the Administrative Agent, (ii) a Securities
Account, to enter into a Securities Account Control Agreement with the Administrative Agent in order to give the Administrative Agent
Control of such Securities Account, or (iii) a Lock Box, to enter into a Lock Box Agreement with the Administrative Agent in order
to give the Administrative Agent Control of the Lock Box and provide for a daily sweep into the Collection Account or another account
designated by the Administrative Agent. In the case of Deposit Accounts, Securities Accounts or Lock Boxes maintained with Lenders, the
terms of such letter shall be subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement regarding setoffs.
7.3.           
Application

accordance with Section 2.18 of the Credit Agreement and shall, after having been credited to the Collection Account, be applied
(and allocated) by Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.10(b) of the Credit Agreement; 
provided
 that, so
long as no Cash Dominion Period has occurred and is continuing, collections which are received into the Collection Account shall be deposited
daily into the Borrower’s Funding Account rather than being used to reduce amounts owing under the Credit Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall require all other cash proceeds of the Collateral, which are not required to be applied to the Obligations pursuant to Section 2.11
of the Credit Agreement, to be deposited in a special non-interest bearing cash collateral account with the Administrative Agent and
held there as security for the Secured Obligations. No Grantor shall have any control whatsoever over said cash collateral account. Any
such proceeds of the Collateral shall be applied in the order set forth in Section 2.18 of the Credit Agreement unless a court of
competent jurisdiction shall otherwise direct. The balance, if any, after all of the Secured Obligations have been satisfied, shall be
deposited by the Administrative Agent into such Grantor’s general operating account with the Administrative Agent. The Grantors
shall remain liable, jointly and severally, for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient
to pay all Secured Obligations, including any attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party to collect such deficiency.
22
ARTICLE VIII
GENERAL PROVISIONS
8.1.           
Waivers
.
Each Grantor hereby waives notice of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale or other disposition
of all or any part of the Collateral may be made. To the extent such notice may not be waived under applicable law, any notice made shall
be deemed reasonable if sent to the Grantors, addressed as set forth in Article IX, at least ten days prior to (a) the date
of any such public sale or (b) the time after which any such private sale or other disposition may be made. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages, and demands against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
Party arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral, except such as arise out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party as found by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. To the extent it may lawfully do so, each Grantor absolutely and irrevocably waives and relinquishes the benefit and advantage
of, and covenants not to assert against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, any valuation, stay, appraisal, extension,
moratorium, redemption or similar laws and any and all rights or defenses it may have as a surety now or hereafter existing which, but
for this provision, might be applicable to the sale of any Collateral made under the judgment, order or decree of any court, or privately
under the power of sale conferred by this Security Agreement, or otherwise. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Grantor
hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection
with this Security Agreement or any Collateral.
8.2.           
Limitation
on Administrative Agent’s and Other Secured Parties’ Duty with Respect to the Collateral
. The Administrative Agent shall
have no obligation to clean-up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale. The Administrative Agent and each other Secured Party shall
use reasonable care with respect to the Collateral in its possession or under its control. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other
Secured Party shall have any other duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent
or nominee of the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party, or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against
prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Administrative Agent to
exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that it is commercially reasonable for the
Administrative Agent to (a) fail to incur expenses deemed significant by the Administrative Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition
or otherwise to transform raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (b) fail
to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to
obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) fail
to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse
claims against Collateral, (d) exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly
or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications
or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) contact other Persons, whether or
not in the same business as such Grantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of the Collateral, (g) hire
one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature,
(h) dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral
or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) dispose of assets in wholesale
rather than retail markets, (j) disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (k) purchase
insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Administrative Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or
to provide to the Administrative Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (l) the extent deemed
appropriate by the Administrative Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals
to assist the Administrative Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose
of this Section 8.2 is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Administrative Agent would be commercially
reasonable in the Administrative Agent’s exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the
Administrative Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 8.2.
Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 8.2 shall be construed to grant any rights to any Grantor
or to impose any duties on the Administrative Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Security Agreement or by applicable
law in the absence of this Section 8.2.
23
8.3.           
Compromises
and Collection of Collateral
. The Grantors and the Administrative Agent recognize that setoffs, counterclaims, defenses and other
claims may be asserted by obligors with respect to certain of the Receivables, that certain of the Receivables may be or become uncollectible
in whole or in part and that the expense and probability of success in litigating a disputed Receivable may exceed the amount that reasonably
may be expected to be recovered with respect to a Receivable. In view of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent
may at any time and from time to time, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, compromise with the obligor on any Receivable,
accept in full payment of any Receivable such amount as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall determine or abandon any
Receivable, and any such action by the Administrative Agent shall be commercially reasonable so long as the Administrative Agent acts
in good faith based on information known to it at the time it takes any such action.
8.4.           
Secured
Party Performance of Debtor Obligations
. Without having any obligation to do so, the Administrative Agent may perform or pay any
obligation which any Grantor has agreed to perform or pay in this Security Agreement and the Grantors shall reimburse the Administrative
Agent for any amounts paid by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.4. The Grantors’ obligation to reimburse
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be a Secured Obligation payable on demand.
8.5.           
Specific
Performance of Certain Covenants
. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in Sections
4.1(d), 4.1(e), 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 5.3, 5.4 or 8.7 or in Article VII will cause irreparable
injury to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, that the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties have no
adequate remedy at law in respect of such breaches and therefore agrees, without limiting the right of the Administrative Agent or the
other Secured Parties to seek and obtain specific performance of other obligations of the Grantors contained in this Security Agreement,
that the covenants of the Grantors contained in the Sections referred to in this Section 8.5 shall be specifically enforceable against
the Grantors.
8.6.           
Dispositions
Not Authorized
. No Grantor is authorized to sell or otherwise Dispose of the Collateral except as set forth in Section 4.1(d) and
notwithstanding any course of dealing between any Grantor and the Administrative Agent or other conduct of the Administrative Agent,
no authorization to sell or otherwise Dispose of the Collateral (except as set forth in Section 4.1(d)) shall be binding upon the
Administrative Agent or the other Secured Parties unless such authorization is in writing signed by the Administrative Agent with the
consent or at the direction of the Required Secured Parties.
8.7.           
No
Waiver; Amendments; Cumulative Remedies
. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising
any right or power under this Security Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of
this Security Agreement or consent to any departure by the Grantors therefrom shall in any event be effective unless in writing signed
by the Administrative Agent with the concurrence or at the direction of the Lenders required under Section 9.02 of the Credit Agreement
and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth.
24
8.8.           
Limitation
by Law; Severability of Provisions
. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Security Agreement may be exercised only to
the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Security Agreement
are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary
so that they shall not render this Security Agreement invalid, unenforceable or not entitled to be recorded or registered, in whole or
in part. Any provision in this Security Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of this Security Agreement are declared to be
severable.
8.9.           
Reinstatement
.
This Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against
any Grantor for liquidation or reorganization, should any Grantor become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor
or creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of any Grantor’s assets, and shall continue
to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Secured Obligations, or any part
thereof (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff), is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in
amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of the Secured Obligations, whether as a “voidable preference,”
“fraudulent conveyance,” or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Secured Party in its discretion),
all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof (including a payment
effected through exercise of a right of setoff), is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Secured Obligations shall be reinstated
and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned.
8.10.         
Benefit
of Agreement
. The terms and provisions of this Security Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Grantors,
the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns (including all persons who become
bound as a debtor to this Security Agreement), except that no Grantor shall have the right to assign its rights or delegate its obligations
under this Security Agreement or any interest herein, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. No sales of participations,
assignments, transfers, or other dispositions of any agreement governing the Secured Obligations or any portion thereof or interest therein
shall in any manner impair the Lien granted to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
Parties, hereunder.
8.11.

Exhibit 99.1
Strata Announces Closing of Revolving Credit Facility to Support
Acquisition Strategy Execution
·
$30 million ABL Facility will support future acquisitions and be undrawn at close; can be increased to $50 million, subject to certain
conditions
·
Owned aircraft excluded from collateral package and remain unencumbered
New York, Feb 5, 2026 -- Strata Critical Medical, Inc. (Nasdaq:
SRTA, “Strata” or the “Company”), a leading provider of logistics and medical services in the organ transplant
industry, today announced that the Company has entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for secured, asset-based
revolving credit loans in aggregate principal amount of up to $30.0 million, which, subject to certain conditions, may be increased up
to an aggregate of $50.0 million (the “ABL Facility”).
“This facility will improve Strata’s capital efficiency,
enabling deployment of more cash towards attractive acquisition opportunities,” said Amir Cohen, Strata’s Chief Accounting
and Integration Officer. “By leaving our owned aircraft fleet unencumbered, we are maintaining significant optionality for additional
financing in the future.”
“We have a strong track record of successful tuck-in acquisitions
in the clinical perfusion space,” said Mat Schneider, CFO of Strata’s Clinical division and VP, IR. “This new facility
will enable us to continue executing on our time-tested playbook to accelerate growth.”
