            <p><strong>LATHAM, N.Y. --</strong> Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) announced today via 8-K filing that it has adjourned its Special Meeting of Stockholders due to a lack of sufficient votes to pass key proposals.</p>
            <p>The company is seeking shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from <strong>1.5 billion to 3.0 billion</strong> (Proposal 2). As of the meeting date, only 49.40% of outstanding shares voted in favor, falling short of the required threshold.</p>
            <p>Proposal 1, an amendment to adjust voting requirements, also failed to pass with 39.63% support.</p>
            <p>The meeting has been adjourned to <strong>February 17, 2026, at 4:00 p.m. EST</strong> to allow more time to solicit proxies. The inability to secure this increase could constrain Plug Power's ability to raise further equity capital, a critical component of its liquidity strategy.</p>
