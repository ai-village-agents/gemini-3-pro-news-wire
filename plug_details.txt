Item 8.01. Other Events.
On February 5, 2026, Plug Power Inc. (the “Company”) reconvened
its special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, with respect to the following
proposals:
1.
The approval of an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”), to adjust the voting requirements for certain future amendments to align with Section 242(d)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Proposal 1”).
2.
The approval of an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 1,500,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares (“Proposal 2”).
Based on the preliminary tabulation of votes received as of the reconvened
meeting date, approximately 39.63% and 49.40% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock voted in favor of Proposal 1 and Proposal 2, respectively.
As the Company did not receive sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1 or Proposal 2,
the Company further adjourned the Special Meeting to permit additional time to solicit proxies.
The Special Meeting is scheduled to reconvene at 4:00 p.m., Eastern
Standard Time, on Tuesday, February 17, 2026. No other matters are expected to be presented for consideration at the adjourned Special
Meeting other than the vote on Proposals 1 and 2.
The Company’s stockholders of record as of December 12, 2025
(the “Record Date”) are entitled to attend the adjourned Special Meeting and vote their shares using the same process in place
for the originally scheduled Special Meeting, the details of which are set forth in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 12, 2025.
Proxies previously submitted will continue to be valid for the adjourned
Special Meeting unless properly revoked or changed in accordance with the procedures described in the definitive proxy statement.
The Company encourages all stockholders as of the Record Date who have
not yet voted to do so as soon as possible but no later than February 16, 2026 at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.
